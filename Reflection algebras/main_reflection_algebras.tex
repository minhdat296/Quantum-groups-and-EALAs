        We compare two constructions of so-called \say{reflection algebras}, due to Sklyanin and Guay-Regelskis-Wendlandt and study the effects of the differences towards their representation theories.

    \section{Introduction}
        \subsection{Outline}

        \subsection{Notations}
            A \say{formal distribution} in $n$ variables $z_1, ..., z_n$ with coefficients in a vector space $U$ is an element of the vector space $U[\![z_1^{\pm}, ..., z_n^{\pm}]\!]$. It is very important to note that even when $U$ is an associative algebra, $U[\![z_1^{\pm}, ..., z_n^{\pm}]\!]$ is \textit{not} an algebra in general. This is because the coefficients of monomials in a product of the form:
                $$\left( \sum_{(i_1, ..., i_n) \in \Z^n} a^{(i_1), ..., (i_n)} z_1^{i_1} ... z_n^{i_n} \right) \left( \sum_{(j_1, ..., j_n) \in \Z^n} b^{(j_1), ..., (j_n)} z_1^{j_1} ... z_n^{j_n} \right)$$
            (wherein $a^{(i_1), ..., (i_n)}, b^{(j_1), ..., (j_n)} \in U$) are of the form:
                $$\sum_{(i_1, ..., i_n) \in \Z^n} \sum_{(j_1, ..., j_n) \in \Z^n} a^{(i_1), ..., (i_n)} b^{(j_1), ..., (j_n)}$$
            which, generally speaking, shall be an infinite sum.

            In the single-variable case, we have the following additional notations. Given any formal distribution:
                $$a(z) := \sum_{m \in \Z} a^{(m)} z^{-m - 1}$$
            let us write:
                $$a(z)^- := \sum_{m \in \Z_{\geq 0}} a^{(m)} z^{-m - 1}, a(z)^+ := \sum_{m \in \Z_{< 0}} a^{(m)} z^{-m - 1}$$
            This is mostly to conform with notational conventions from mathematical physics, but as a side bonus, we also get:
                $$(\del a(z))^{\pm} = \del( a(z)^{\pm} )$$

            All throughout:
                $$\g_N \subset \gl_N$$
            will be used to denote a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra over $\bbC$, often of one of the types $\sfB, \sfC, \sfD$ in the Cartan-Killing classification. This Lie algebra has a natural action on $U := \bbC^{\oplus N}$ (the so-called \say{vector representation}), which shall always be equipped with the standard basis:
                $$\{e_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq N}$$
            consisting of vectors with $1$ in the $i^{th}$ entry and $0$ elsewhere. By finite-dimensionality, we identify:
                $$U^{\tensor 2} \xrightarrow[]{\cong} \End(U)$$
            and then write:
                $$E_{i, j}$$
            for the image of $e_i \tensor e_j$ under the identification above; explicitly, $E_{i, j}$ is the $N \x N$ matrix with $1$ in the $(i, j)^{th}$ entry and $0$ elsewhere.
