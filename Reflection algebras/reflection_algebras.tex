\section{Reflection algebras}
    Our task for the section is to compare the reflection algebra constructions of Sklyanin and of Guay-Regelskis-Wendlandt. We do this in preparation for studying modules over these algebras, and we would like to know how the discrepancies between the two constructions - should there be any - impacts the respective representation theories.

    \subsection{The scattering reflection algebras of Sklyanin}
        What we propose to called the  \say{scattering reflection algebras} appeared for the first time in the work \cite{sklyanin_boundary_conditions_for_integrable_quantum_systems}, wherein these algebras appear as quantum symmetries that describe scattering phenomena. Later on, they received interests from Molev and Ragoucy in \cite{molev_ragoucy_representations_of_reflection_algebras}, wherein the authors classified the finite-dimensional simple modules over these algebras. These reflection algebras also made an appearance in \cite{isaev_molev_ogievetsky_fusion_for_brauer_algebras_2} (see also \cite{isaev_molev_fusion_for_brauer_algebras_1}) due to the fact that they admit a kind of evaluation homomorphism to the universal enveloping algebras of classical Lie algebras of types $\sfB, \sfC, \sfD$, and thus helped alleviate a technical difficulty in the representation theory of \say{twisted Yangians} of the aforementioned types.

        \begin{definition}[Scattering reflection algebras] \label{def: scatteering_reflection_algebras}
            The \textbf{scattering reflection algebra} of Sklyanin, associated to a classical Lie algebra $\g_N$ of one of the types $\sfB, \sfC, \sfD$, is the associated algebra:
                $$\scattering(\g_N)$$
            generated by the set formal power series:
                $$\{ s_{i, j}(z)^- \}_{1 \leq i, j \leq N} \subset z^{-1}\scattering(\g_N)[\![z^{-1}]\!]$$
            whose elements are subjected to the following relations:
                
        \end{definition}
