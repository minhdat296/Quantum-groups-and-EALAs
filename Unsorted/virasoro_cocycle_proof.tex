        This is a quick proof that the Witt algebra has only two distinct isomorphism classes of central extensions, namely the trivial central extension and its UCE (by a $1$-dimensional centre), the Virasoro algebra.

    \begin{proposition}[A Virasoro $2$-coboundary] \label{prop: a_virasoro_coboundary}
        Let:
            $$\eta': \bigwedge^2 \der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}]) \to \bbC c_{\frakv}$$
        be the function given by:
            $$\eta'(d_r, d_a) := \delta_{r + a, 0} r c_{\frakv}$$
        This is a $2$-cocycle of $\der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}])$ with values in $\bbC c_{\frakv}$. From this, one sees that:
            $$\eta + \eta': \bigwedge^2 \der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}]) \to \bbC c_{\frakv}$$
        (which is given by $(\eta + \eta')(d_r, d_a) := \delta_{r + a, 0} r^3 c_{\frakv}$) is also a $2$-cocycle of $\der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}])$ with values in $\bbC c_{\frakv}$. 

        Furthermore, we have that:
            $$\eta' \in B^2_{\Lie}( \der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}]), \bbC c_{\frakv} )$$
    \end{proposition}
        \begin{proof}
            It is clear from the construction of $\eta'$ that it is linear and skew-symmetric; the only non-trivial thing to prove is that $\eta'$ satisfies the Jacobi identity. To this end, simply consider the following, for all $i, j, k \in \Z$:
                $$
                    \begin{aligned}
                        & \eta'([d_i, d_j], d_k) + \eta'([d_k, d_i], d_j) + \eta'([d_j, d_k], d_i)
                        \\
                        = & (i - j) \eta'(d_{i + j}, d_k) + (k - i) \eta'(d_{k + i}, d_j) + (j - k) \eta'(d_{j + k}, d_i)
                        \\
                        = & \delta_{i + j + k, 0} \left( (i - j) (i + j) + (k - i) (k + i) + (j - k) (j + k) \right) c_{\frakv}
                        \\
                        = & 0
                    \end{aligned}
                $$
                
            To show that $\eta'$ is a Lie $2$-coboundary, we must show that there exists a linear map:
                $$\tilde{\eta'}: \der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}]) \to \bbC c_{\frakv}$$
            which is merely a linear map, such that:
                $$\eta(d_i, d_j) = \tilde{\eta'}([d_i, d_j])$$
            The RHS is nothing but:
                $$\tilde{\eta'}([d_i, d_j]) = (i - j) \tilde{\eta'}(d_{i + j}) c_{\frakv}$$
            while by construction, the LHS is:
                $$\eta(d_i, d_j) := \delta_{i + j, 0} i c_{\frakv}$$
            and hence:
                $$\delta_{i + j, 0} i = (i - j) \tilde{\eta'}(d_{i + j})$$
            By setting $j = 0$, we then see that:
                $$i (\tilde{\eta'}(d_i) - \delta_{i, 0}) = 0$$
            for all $i \in \Z$, which in turn implies that:
                $$\tilde{\eta'}(d_i) = \delta_{i, 0}$$
            The sought-for linear map $\tilde{\eta}: \der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}]) \to \bbC c_{\frakv}$ is thus defined, and hence exists.
        \end{proof}
    \begin{lemma}[$H^2_{\Lie}$ of the Witt algebra] \label{lemma: H^2_of_witt_algebra}
        (Cf. \cite[Proposition 1.3]{kac_raina_rozhkovskaya_bombay_lectures_on_highest_weight_modules_of_infinite_dimensional_lie_algebras}) Fix some $c_{\frakv} \in \bbC^{\x}$ and let $\bbC c_{\frakv}$ be viewed as a trivial $\der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}])$-module. Then:
            $$\dim_{\bbC} H^2_{\Lie}( \der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}]), \bbC c_{\frakv} ) = 1$$
    \end{lemma}
        \begin{proof}
            Note first of all that any Lie $2$-cocycle of $\der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}])$ with values in $\bbC c_{\frakv}$ is necessarily given on basis elements $d_i, d_j \in \der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}])$ by:
                $$\tau(d_i, d_j) = N_{i, j}(\tau) c_{\frakv}$$
            for some $N_{i, j}(\tau) \in \bbC$. By skew-symmetry, we have that:
                $$\tau(d_i, d_j) = -\tau(d_j, d_i)$$
            for all $i, j \in \Z$, and hence:
                $$N_{i, j}(\tau) = -N_{j, i}(\tau)$$
            By the Jacobi identity, we the following, for all $i, j, k \in \Z$:
                $$
                    \begin{aligned}
                        & 0
                        \\
                        = & \tau([d_i, d_j], d_k) + \tau([d_k, d_i], d_j) + \tau([d_j, d_k], d_i)
                        \\
                        = & (i - j) \tau(d_{i + j}, d_k) + (k - i) \tau(d_{k + i}, d_j) + (j - k) \tau(d_{j + k}, d_i)
                        \\
                        = & \left( (i - j) N_{i + j, k}(\tau) + (k - i) N_{k + i, j}(\tau) + (j - k) N_{j + k, i}(\tau) \right) c_{\frakv}
                    \end{aligned}
                $$
            which implies that:
                $$(i - j) N_{i + j, k}(\tau) + (k - i) N_{k + i, j}(\tau) + (j - k) N_{j + k, i}(\tau) = 0$$
            If we let $k = 0$ then we will get:
                $$(i - j) N_{i + j, 0}(\tau) - i N_{i, j}(\tau) + j N_{j, i}(\tau) = 0$$
            but since we have that $N_{j, i}(\tau) = -N_{i, j}(\tau)$, as shown above, the above becomes:
                $$(i - j) N_{i + j, 0}(\tau) = (i + j) N_{i, j}(\tau)$$
            Using this, we thus get that:
                $$
                    \begin{aligned}
                        & [[d_i, d_j]_{\frakv}, d_0]_{\frakv} = (i - j) [d_{i + j}, d_0]_{\frakv}
                        \\
                        = & (i - j) \left( (i + j) d_{i + j} + N_{i, j, 0}(\tau) c_{\frakv} \right)
                        \\
                        = & (i + j) [d_i, d_j] + (i + j) N_{i, j}(\tau) c_{\frakv}
                    \end{aligned}
                $$
            At the same time, the Jacobi identity implies that:
                $$
                    \begin{aligned}
                        & 0
                        \\
                        = & [[d_i, d_j]_{\frakv}, d_0]_{\frakv} + [[d_0, d_i]_{\frakv}, d_j]_{\frakv} + [[d_j, d_0]_{\frakv}, d_i]_{\frakv}
                        \\
                        = & [[d_i, d_j]_{\frakv}, d_0]_{\frakv} - i [d_i, d_j]_{\frakv} + j [d_j, d_i]_{\frakv}
                        \\
                        = & [[d_i, d_j]_{\frakv}, d_0]_{\frakv} - (i + j) [d_i, d_j]_{\frakv}
                    \end{aligned}
                $$
            which implies that:
                $$[[d_i, d_j]_{\frakv}, d_0]_{\frakv} = (i + j) [d_i, d_j]_{\frakv}$$
            Combining the two observations then yields:
                $$(i + j) N_{i, j}(\tau) = 0$$
            from which one sees that:
                $$N_{i, j}(\tau) = \delta_{i + j, 0} N_{i, -i}(\tau)$$
            Now, consider once more the Jacobi identity for $\tau$:
                $$
                    \begin{aligned}
                        & 0
                        \\
                        = & (i - j) N_{i + j, k}(\tau) + (k - i) N_{k + i, j}(\tau) + (j - k) N_{j + k, i}(\tau)
                        \\
                        = & \delta_{i + j + k, 0} \left( (i - j)  N_{i + j, -(i + j)}(\tau) + (k - i) N_{k + i, -(k + i)}(\tau) + (j - k) N_{j + k, -(j + k)}(\tau) \right)
                        \\
                        = & (i - j)  N_{i + j, -(i + j)}(\tau) + (-(i + j) - i) N_{-(i + j) + i, -(-(i + j) + i)}(\tau) + (j + (i + j)) N_{j - (i + j), -(j -(i + j))}(\tau)
                        \\
                        = & (i - j)  N_{i + j, -(i + j)}(\tau) - (2i + j) N_{-j, j}(\tau) + (i + 2j) N_{-i, i}(\tau)
                    \end{aligned}
                $$
            By setting $j = 1$ and each $f_r := N_{r, -r}(\tau)$ (for all $r \in \Z \geq 0$, assuming $\tau$ is fixed), we shall then get:
                $$(i - 1) f_{i + 1} - (i + 2) f_i = -(2i + 1) f_1$$
            for all $i \in \Z_{\geq 2}$. This is a difference equation with initial condition:
                $$f_0 = N_{0, 0} = 0$$
            coming from the skew-symmetry of $N_{i, j}$. We note also, that knowing $f_1$ and $f_2$ would help us determine $f_{i + 1}$ for all $i \in \Z_{\geq 2}$, so the equation is of order $2$. The vector space of solutions is therefore of dimension $\leq 2$, though in light of the fact that:
                $$\eta \not = \eta' \in Z^2_{\Lie}(\der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}]), \bbC c_{\frakv})$$
            we actually have that the solution space is $2$-dimensional, say:
                $$Z^2_{\Lie}(\der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}]), \bbC c_{\frakv}) \cong \bbC \eta \oplus \bbC \eta'$$

            Now, let:
                $$\eta \in Z^2_{\Lie}(\der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}], \bbC c_{\frakv}))$$
            be given by:
                $$\eta(d_r, d_a) := \delta_{r + a, 0} (r^3 - r) c_{\frakv}$$
            If we can show that $\eta$ is \textit{not} a Lie $2$-coboundary of $\der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}])$ with values in $\bbC c_{\frakv}$, we will have that:
                $$B^2_{\Lie}(\der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}]), \bbC c_{\frakv}) \cong \bbC \eta'$$
            from propostion \ref{prop: a_virasoro_coboundary}, and hence that:
                $$H^2_{\Lie}(\der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}]), \bbC c_{\frakv}) \cong \bbC \eta$$
            which would give:
                $$\dim_{\bbC} H^2_{\Lie}(\der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}]), \bbC c_{\frakv}) = 1$$
            as desired. For this, we shall need to prove that there does \textit{not} exist a linear map $\tilde{\eta}: \der(\bbC[v^{\pm 1}]) \to \bbC c_{\frakv}$ such that:
                $$\eta(d_i, d_j) = \tilde{\eta}([d_i, d_j])$$
            Suppose for the sake of deriving a contradiction, that there does exist such a linear map $\tilde{\eta}$. We would then have that:
                $$\delta_{i + j, 0} (i^3 - i) c_{\frakv} = \eta(d_i, d_j) = \tilde{\eta}([d_i, d_j]) = (i - j) \tilde{\eta}(d_{i + j}) c_{\frakv}$$
            for all $i, j \in \Z$, which in turn implies that:
                $$i^3 - i = 2i \tilde{\eta}(d_0)$$
            when $i + j = 0$. By re-arranging, we shall get:
                $$\tilde{\eta}(d_0) = \frac12(i^2 - 1)$$
            whenever $i \not = 0$, but this implies that $\tilde{\eta}(d_0)$ depends on $i$, which is absurd. We thus have a contradiction, and the linear map $\tilde{\eta}$ therefore can not exist. $\eta$ is thus not $2$-coboundary.
        \end{proof}
