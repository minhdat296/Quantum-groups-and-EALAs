    \subsection{Highest-weight modules}
        When $q$ is not a root of unity, it turns out that the theory of highest-weight modules for $\rmU_q$ and for $\rmU$ do not differ very much. As such, we will only be providing an outline of the important results here, leaving the details of the proofs up to the reader. Most of the proofs are rather similar to those that can be found in say, \cite[Chapterr VI]{humphreys_lie_algebras}.
