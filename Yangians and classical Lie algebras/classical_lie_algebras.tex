\section{Classical Lie algebras}
    In this section, we recall and supplement some well-known facts about the structure of finite-dimensional simple modules over Lie algebras belonging to the classical types - i.e. types $\sfA, \sfB, \sfC, \sfD$ - under the Cartan-Killing classification; for more details, see \cite{carter_affine_lie_algebras}.
