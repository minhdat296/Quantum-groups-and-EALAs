    \subsection{Digression: reflection algebras}
        In this subsection, we discuss so-called \say{reflection algebras}, which are essentially instances twisted Yangians that appear rather prominently in the study of quantum inverse scattering in the presence of boundary conditions. In particular, we are interested the reflection algebras of Molev-Ragoucy (from \cite{molev_ragoucy_representations_of_reflection_algebras}) and those of Isaev-Molev-Ogievetsky (from \cite{isaev_molev_ogievetsky_fusion_for_brauer_algebras_2}) which, respectively, are \textit{non-trivially} isomorphic to the twisted Yangians associated to the symmetric pairs of types $\sfA\romanthree$ and $\sfB\sfC\sfD\romanzero$.
