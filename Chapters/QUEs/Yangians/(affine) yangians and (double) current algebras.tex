\section{(Affine) Yangians and (double) current algebras}
    \subsection{Lie bialgebra structures on (double) current Lie algebras}
        Let us begin with the following observation. Suppose that $(V, \beta_0)$ is an inner product space over $\bbC$ (i.e. a vector space equipped with a symmetric and non-degenerate bilinear form\footnote{We do not require positive-definiteness!}) such that:
            $$V \cong V^*$$
        with respect to $\beta_0$, and consider the following triple of $\bbC$-vector spaces:
            $$( V(\!(t^{-1})\!), V[t], t^{-1}V[\![t^{-1}]\!] )$$
        Firstly, it is clear that:
            $$V(\!(t^{-1})\!) \cong V[t] \oplus t^{-1}V[\![t^{-1}]\!]$$
        and secondly, by endowing $V(\!(t^{-1})\!)$ with the symmetric bilinear form given by:
            $$\beta(x \tensor t^p, y \tensor t^q) := \beta_0(x, y) \Res_{t = 0}(t^p, t^q)$$
        wherein:
            $$\Res_{t = 0}(t^p, t^q) := -\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\bbS^1} t^p dt^q = \delta_{p + q, -1}$$
        From this, it is clear that the bilinear form $\beta$ is non-degenerate, pairs the vector subspaces $V[t]$ and $t^{-1}V[\![t^{-1}]\!]$ isotropically and secondly, that via $\beta$, we have a continuous isomorphism of $\bbC$-vector spaces:
            $$V[t]^* \cong (\bigoplus_{p \geq 0} V \tensor t^p)^* \cong \prod_{p \geq 0} (V \tensor t^p)^* \cong \prod_{p \geq 0} V \tensor t^{-p - 1} \cong t^{-1}V[\![t^{-1}]\!]$$
        In particular, if $\{x_i\}_{i \in I} \subset V$ is a basis and $\{x_i^*\}_{i \in I} \subset V^*$ is the continuous dual basis with respect to $\beta_0$ (which is of the same cardinality thanks to the Riesz Representation Theorem) then the continuous isomorphism above will be given by:
            $$x_i \tensor t^p \mapsto x_i^* \tensor t^{-p - 1}$$
        (indeed, we have that $\beta(x_j^* \tensor t^{-q - 1}, x_i \tensor t^p) = \delta_{i, j} \delta_{p, q}$ for all $i, j \in I$ and all $p, q \geq 0$). 

        When $V$ is a Lie algebra and $\beta_0$ is a $V$-invariant inner product, the induced \say{residue form} $\beta$ will also be $V$-invariant, and hence we will have obtained a Manin triple:
            $$( V(\!(t^{-1})\!), V[t], t^{-1}V[\![t^{-1}]\!] )$$
        This \textit{a priori} induces a Lie bialgebra structure on $V[t]$, wherein the Lie cobracket:
            $$\delta_{V[t]}: t^{-1}V[\![t^{-1}]\!] \to t^{-1}V[\![t^{-1}]\!] \tensor_{\bbC} t^{-1}V[\![t^{-1}]\!]$$
        is given by:
            $$\delta_{V[t]} := [-, -]_{t^{-1}V[\![t^{-1}]\!]}^*$$
        note that this is well-defined since:
            $$(W \tensor_{\bbC} W')^* \subseteq W^* \tensor_{\bbC} W'^*$$
        for any pair of vector spaces $W, W'$, which in particular implies that:
            $$(V[t] \tensor_{\bbC} V[t])^* \subseteq V[t]^* \tensor_{\bbC} V[t]^* \cong t^{-1}V[\![t^{-1}]\!] \tensor_{\bbC} t^{-1}V[\![t^{-1}]\!]$$
        
    
        \subsubsection{Lie cobrackets on \texorpdfstring{$\g[t]$}{}}
            Now, let $\g$ be a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra over $\bbC$ and denote the Casimir element of $\g$ by $R_{\g}$ (recall that this is basis-independent). 

            By taking $\beta_0 := \kappa$ to be the Killing form on $\g$ (which is an invariant inner product on $\g$), we can establish the following Manin triple:
                $$( \g(\!(t^{-1})\!), \g[t], t^{-1}\g[\![t^{-1}]\!] )$$
            wherein the invariant inner product on $\g(\!(t^{-1})\!)$ is given by:
                $$\beta(x \tensor t^p, y \tensor t^q) := \kappa(x, y) \delta_{p + q, -1}$$
            for all $p, q \in \Z$. 

        \subsubsection{Lie cobrackets on \texorpdfstring{$\g[v^{\pm 1}][t]$}{}}
            Suppose still that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra over $\bbC$.
        
            Just as above, we see that order to construct a Lie bialgebra structure on $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t]$, it shall suffice to construct a $\g[v^{\pm 1}]$-invariant inner product on $\g[v^{\pm 1}]$, as this would give rise to a Manin triple:
                $$(\p, \p_+, \p_-)$$
            with $\p_+ \cong \g[v^{\pm 1}][t]$.
                
            To this end, suppose that:
                $$C := D A$$
            is any indecomposable $n \x n$ symmetrisable GCM (for some $n \geq 1$) which decomposes into the product of an \textit{invertible} diagonal matrix $D$ and a symmetric matrix $A$, and $L$ is the corresponding Kac-Moody algebra. Fix also all the usual relevant data of a Cartan subalgera $\h$, a corresponding root system $\Phi$, etc.; we shall be using the standard notations as in \cite[Chapter 5]{kac_infinite_dimensional_lie_algebras}. Recall also that $L$ has a root space decomposition:
                $$L \cong (\bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Re(\Phi)^+} L_{-\alpha}) \oplus \h \oplus (\bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Re(\Phi)^+} L_{\alpha})$$
            (in fact, this holds regardless of whether or not $C$ is symmetrisable) wherein the root spaces $L_{\pm \alpha}$ for all $\alpha \in \Re(\Phi)^+$ are equally $1$-dimensional \textit{a priori}. Now, denote:
                $$\h' := \bigoplus_{1 \leq i \leq n} \bbC \alpha_i^{\vee}$$
            and write $\h''$ for the orthogonal complement of $\h' \subseteq \h$. According to \cite[Theorem 2.2]{kac_infinite_dimensional_lie_algebras}, there exists an $L$-invariant and non-degenerate bilinear form $\hat{\kappa}$ on $L$ given by:
                \todo[inline]{How is $\hat{\kappa}$ given ?}
            Recall also (cf. \cite[Chapter 7]{kac_infinite_dimensional_lie_algebras}) that when $C$ is of untwisted affine type, it will admit an $l \x l$ submatrix $C^{\circ}$ ($l = n - 1$; note that in this case $l \geq 2$ \textit{a priori}) obtained by deleting the first row and column which is \textit{a priori} of finite-type and is such that:
                $$L \cong L^{\circ}[v^{\pm 1}] \oplus \bbC c \oplus \bbC d$$
            wherein $L^{\circ}$ is the finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra associated to $C^{\circ}$, $\widetilde{L^{\circ}[v^{\pm 1}]} := L^{\circ}[v^{\pm 1}] \oplus \bbC c$ is a $1$-dimensional central extension thereof\footnote{In fact, this is \textit{the} universal central extension of $L^{\circ}[v^{\pm 1}]$}, and $d \in \der(\widetilde{L^{\circ}[v^{\pm 1}]}, \widetilde{L^{\circ}[v^{\pm 1}]})$ is a derivation on $\widetilde{L^{\circ}[v^{\pm 1}]}$ acting as $v\frac{d}{dv}$ on $L^{\circ}[v^{\pm 1}]$ and as $0$ on $\bbC c$. There thus exists a restriction $\beta_0 := \hat{\kappa}|_{L^{\circ}[v^{\pm 1}]}$ of $\hat{\kappa}$ from $L$ down onto $L^{\circ}[v^{\pm 1}]$, which can be easily seen to also remain symmetric, invariant, and non-degenerate\footnote{This is true more generally for the restriction of any invariant inner product on a Lie algebra down to a Lie subalgebra thereof.}. In particular, let us make the following final recollection (cf. \cite[Section 7.5]{kac_infinite_dimensional_lie_algebras}) that the following holds for all $x, y \in L^{\circ}$ and all $a, b \in \Z$:
                $$\hat{\kappa}(x \tensor v^a, y \tensor v^b) = \kappa(x, y) \Res_{v = 0}(t^a, t^b) = \kappa(x, y) \delta_{a + b, -1}$$
                $$\hat{\kappa}(d, d) = \hat{\kappa}(c, c) = 0, \hat{\kappa}(c, d) = 1$$
            wherein $\kappa$ is the Killing form on $L^{\circ}$; from this, it is evident that:
                $$\g[v^{\pm 1}]^* \cong (\bigoplus_{a \in \Z} \g \tensor v^a)^* \cong \prod_{a \in \Z} (\g \tensor v^a)^* \cong \prod_{a \in \Z} \g \tensor v^{-a - 1} \cong \g(\!(v^{-1})\!)$$
            via $\beta_0$. Before we proceed, note that:
                $$\g[v^{\pm 1}] \oplus \g(\!(v'^{-1})\!) \cong \g[v][v^{-1}] \oplus \g[\![v'^{-1}]\!][v^{-1}] \cong \g(\!(v^{-1})\!)[v^{-1}] \cong \g(\!(v^{-1})\!)$$
            due to the fact that localisations and direct sums commute with one another.
            
            Now, let $L^{\circ} := \g$. The existence of the invariant inner product $\beta_0$ on $\g[v^{\pm 1}]$ as above is precisely what is needed for the construction of a Manin triple:
                $$( \g(\!(v^{-1})\!)(\!(t^{-1})\!) , \g[v^{\pm 1}][t], t^{-1} \g(\!(v^{-1})\!)[\![t]\!] )$$
            wherein $\g(\!(v^{-1})\!)(\!(t^{-1})\!)$ is endowed with the induced invariant inner product:
                $$\beta(x \tensor v^a t^p, y \tensor v^b t^q) := \kappa(x, y) \delta_{a + b, -1} \delta_{p + q, -1}$$
            given for all $a, b, p, q \in \Z$. The Lie coalgebra structure on $\g[v^{\pm 1}][t]$ can then be seen to be explicitly given by:
