                The \textbf{split Grothendieck group} of an abelian category $\E$, denoted by $\K_0^{\indecomp}(\E)$, is defined to be the abelian group generated by the set of isomorphism classes of objects of $\E$, subjected to the relations:
                    $$[M] = [M'] + [M'']$$
                whenever $0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0$ is a short exact sequence in $\E$ that \textit{splits}.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{proposition}[Split Grothendieck groups are free on indecomposable objects] \label{prop: split_grothendieck_groups_of_finite_linear_abelian_categories_are_free_on_indecomposable_objects} 
                Let $k$ be an Artinian commutative ring and $\E$ be a finite $k$-linear abelian category with coefficient algebra $A$ (cf. definition \ref{def: finite_linear_categories}). The split Grothendieck group $\K_0^{\indecomp}(\E)$ will then be isomorphic to the free abelian group on the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects\footnote{Hence the notation.} of $\E$, i.e.:
                    $$\K_0^{\indecomp}(\E) \cong \Z^{\oplus [\E^{\indecomp}]}$$
            \end{proposition}
                \begin{proof}
                    
                \end{proof}
            \begin{remark}[Finiteness of split Grothendieck groups] \label{remark: finiteness_of_split_grothendieck_groups}
                Unlike the simple/projective Grothendieck group, the split Grothendieck group of a finite $k$-linear abelian category over an Artinian commutative ring $k$ needs not be finitely generated as a $\Z$-module. By theorem \ref{theorem: indecomposable_representations_of_dynkin_quivers_are_labelled_by_positive_roots}, we see one example of a finitely generated split Grothendieck group is that of the category of finite-dimensional representations over a field of a Dynkin quiver. Now, thanks to lemma \ref{lemma: projective_indecomposable_modules_over_artinian_algebras_are_simple}, we know that there is a canonical inclusion:
                    $$[\E^{\simple}] \subseteq [\E^{\indecomp}]$$
                for any finite $k$-linear abelian category over an Artinian commutative ring $k$, which helps us characterise $\K_0^{\simple}(\E)$ as a $\Z$-submodule of $\K_0^{\indecomp}(\E)$. Since finite $k$-linear abelian categories can only have finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects (cf. proposition \ref{prop: simple_objects_in_finite_linear_categories}), i.e.:
                    $$[\E^{\simple}]$$
                is a finite set, one can show that $\E$ has finitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects, i.e. that:
                    $$[\E^{\indecomp}]$$
                is also a finite set, by checking whether or not the quotient:
                    $$\K_0^{\indecomp}(\E)/\K_0^{\simple}(\E)$$
                is finitely generated as a $\Z$-module. 
            \end{remark}
