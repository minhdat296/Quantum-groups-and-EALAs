\section{\texorpdfstring{Boundary $q$-characters for the twisted Yangian of type $\Aone$}{}}
    In this section, we work with the symmetric pair $(\g_N, \g_N^{\vartheta}) = (\sl_N, \so_N)$, also known as the symmetric pair of type $\Aone$. The reason for our restricted attention is that in this case, the Drinfeld-type presentation by Lu-Wang-Zhang for the corresponding twisted Yangian is best understood.
