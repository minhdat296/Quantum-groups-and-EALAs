\section{Fundamental modules over (twisted) Yangians}
    \subsection{Type \texorpdfstring{$\sfA$}{}}
        In this subsection, we investigate the structure of fundamental modules over the untwisted Yangian $\rmY(\g)$, with a particular emphasis on the case $\g = \sl_n$. Like in the representation theory of $\g$, fundamental $\rmY(\g)$-modules are those finite-dimensional simple modules from which one can obtain all other finite-dimensional simple modules as subquotients of tensor products, meaning that it is enough to know only about the structure of these fundamental modules in order to have a full description of all the finite-dimensional simple $\rmY(\g)$-modules. Moreover, in type $\sfA$, thanks to the existence of Schur-Weyl Duality, one can even describe these fundamental modules in further details by writing down bases for them, so-called \say{Gelfand-Tsetlin bases}, which somehow arise from the combinatorics of weights, in a similar manner to how Kashiwara's crystal bases (equivalently, Lusztig's canonical bases) arise.
