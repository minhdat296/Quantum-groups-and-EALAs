\section{Coproducts for affine Yangians}
    These are notes for \cite{guay_nakajima_wendlandt_affine_yangian_coproduct}.
    
    \todo[inline]{I think the point of using $\calO_{\hbar}$ is that - aside from finiteness - this allows us to introduce a completion of $\rmY$ that would accommodate the infinite sums that Kac-Moody Casimir tensors can contain. This is because associativity and braidedness of tensor products in $\calO_{\hbar}$ are ultimately controlled by these Casimir tensors.}
