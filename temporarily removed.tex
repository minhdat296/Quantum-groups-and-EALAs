\begin{lemma}[Projective indecomposable modules over finite algebras are simple] \label{lemma: projective_indecomposable_modules_over_finite_algebras_are_simple}
                \footnote{One interesting consequence of this lemma (which is not too relevant to the current discussion about Dynkin quivers, as path algebras of quivers - even over fields - are generally not semi-simple, only hereditary) is that it implies via lemma \ref{lemma: projective_and_injective_modules_over_semi_simple_rings} that over a semi-simple finite-dimensional algebra over a field, a module is indecomposable if and only if it is simple.} Let $k$ be a field and $A$ be a finite-dimensional $k$-algebra. Then, there exists a surjection:
                    $$
                        \left\{\text{projective left/right-$A$-modules}\right\}
                        \to
                        \left\{\text{simple left/right-$A$-modules}\right\}
                    $$
                whose pre-images over each simple left/right-$A$-module $M$ is a choice of projective cover $\e: P \to M$ which is unique up to isomorphisms. 
            \end{lemma}
                \begin{proof}
                    First of all, because the category of left/right-$A$-modules \textit{a priori} has enough projectives, meaning that for all left/right-$A$-modules $M$ there exists a projective cover $\e: P \to M$, we certainly have a surjection:
                        $$
                            \left\{\text{projective left/right-$A$-modules}\right\}
                            \to
                            \left\{\text{simple left/right-$A$-modules}\right\}
                        $$
                    Now, in order to show that the pre-image of the class of simple left/right-$A$-modules under this surjection is that of indecomposable projective left/right-$A$-modules, start by recalling that simple left/right-modules are cyclic\footnote{The proof is simple (pun not intended!): if we were to suppose to the contrary that there existed a simple module $M$ with $\geq 1$ generators, then said module will admit non-zero (cyclic) proper submodules generated by the generators, and therefore $M$ can not be simple, contradicting our initial assumption.}. This tells us that every simple left/right-$A$-module admits a projective cover by a free\footnote{We assume the Axiom of Choice, so that free module would be projective.} left/right-$A$-module on $1$ generator, which is of course indecomposable and unique up to isomorphisms, per the universal property of left-adjoints.
                \end{proof}
