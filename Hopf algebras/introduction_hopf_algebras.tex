\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Preliminaries}
        For now, we refer the reader to \cite{maclane} for generalities about category theory, and to \cite{EGNO_tensor_categories} for details on the notion of monoidal categories and the various strengthening thereof (symmetric monoidal categories, braided monoidal categories, etc.)\footnote{I will try to write a concise appendix about monoidal categories at some point, just to make these notes self-contained.}. For our intents and purposes, it suffices to only be familiar with tensor products of modules over rings, though it is important that one knows how to work with noncommutative rings; a good reference is \cite{lam_first_course_in_noncommutative_rings}. We assume that the reader is comfortable with modules and commutative algebras over commutative rings.
