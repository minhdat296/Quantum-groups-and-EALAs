\section{A renormalised category \texorpdfstring{$\calO$}{} for affine Kac-Moody algebras}
    \begin{convention}
        Let $\g$ be a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$, and let us equip this with a non-degenerate invariant bilinear form $\kappa$. 
    
        Throughout, we write $\hat{\g}$ to mean the formal affine Kac-Moody algebra obtained as:
            $$\hat{\g} := \tilde{\g} \rtimes \bbC v \frac{d}{dv}$$
        Here, $\tilde{\g} := \uce( \g[\![v]\!] )$ is the universal central extension of the (perfect) Lie algebra $\g[\![v]\!] := \g \tensor_k k[\![v]\!]$, equipped with the non-degenerate invariant bilinear form:
            $$(x v^m, y v^n)_{\g[\![v]\!]} := \kappa(x, y) \delta_{m + n, 0}$$
        (note that this is the usual Kac-Moody form; cf. \cite[Chapters 2 and 7]{kac_infinite_dimensional_lie_algebras}); recall also that $\tilde{\g}$ has a $1$-dimensional centre, say, spanned by an element $c$. $v \frac{d}{dv}$ is to be understood as the derivatino on $\tilde{\g}$ acting as $\id_{\g} \tensor v \frac{d}{dv}$ on $\g[\![v]\!]$ and as zero on $c$. 
    \end{convention}

    \subsection{A compactly generated category of \texorpdfstring{$\hat{\g}$}{}-modules}
        Consider firstly the usual abelian category:
            $$\calO_{\kappa}^{\integrable}(\hat{\g})^{\heart}$$
        of integrable $\hat{\g}$-modules (cf. \cite[Chapter 9]{kac_infinite_dimensional_lie_algebras}). For every weight $\lambda \in \hat{\Lambda}_{\kappa}$, let us write $\1^{\lambda}_{\kappa}$ for the corresponding $1$-dimensional $\hat{\g}$-module. For every maximal solvable Lie subalgebra $\k \subset \g[\![v]\!]$, recall that the induced module/Verma module:
            $$\V^{\lambda}_{\kappa} := \Ind_{\k}^{\hat{\g}} \1^{\lambda}_{\kappa}$$
        remains an object of $\calO_{\kappa}^{\integrable}(\hat{\g})^{\heart}$. Next, let us write:
            $$\calO_{\kappa}(\hat{\g})$$
        for the ind-completion of the full subcategory, generated via finite colimits by the objects $\V^{\lambda}_{\kappa}$, of the (unbounded) derived category $\calO_{\kappa}^{\integrable}(\hat{\g}) := \rmD( \calO_{\kappa}^{\integrable}(\hat{\g})^{\heart} )$, viewed as a stable $\infty$-category. Importantly, the category $\calO_{\kappa}(\hat{\g})$ is compactly generated by construction, with its compact objects being the induced modules $\V^{\lambda}_{\kappa}$. 

        Suppose now, more generally, that $\k \subset \g[\![v]\!]$ is a finite-codimensional Lie subalgebra.
