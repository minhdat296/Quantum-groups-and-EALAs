    \section{Example: A Lie bialgebra structures on \texorpdfstring{$\uce( \g[v^{\pm 1}, t] )$}{}}
        \begin{convention}
            Throughout this section, we fix a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra $\g$ over $\bbC$, equipped with a symmetric and non-degenerate invariant $\bbC$-bilinear form $(-, -)_{\g}$ (which for all intents and purposes shall be the Killing form, but we do not need to make that assumption). 

            Suppose also that $\g$ is equipped with a basis $\{x_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq \dim_{\bbC} \g}$ and with respect to $(-, -)_{\g}$, we identify a dual basis $\{x^i\}_{1 \leq i \leq \dim_{\bbC} \g}$. Recall that the universal Casimir element/canonical element of $\g$ is:
                $$\scrR_{\g} := \sum_{1 \leq i \leq \dim_{\bbC} \g} x_i \tensor x^i \in \g \tensor_{\bbC} \g$$
        \end{convention}

        \begin{convention}
            Throughout, we shall use $(-)^{\star}$ to denote graded duals. 
        \end{convention}

        \begin{convention}
            If $k$ is a commutative ring and $A$ is a $k$-algebra, and if $L$ is a Lie algebra over $k$, then the default Lie algebra structure on the $k$-module $L \tensor_k A$ shall be the one given by extension of scalars, i.e.:
                $$[x \tensor a, y \tensor b]_{L \tensor_k A} := [x, y]_L \mu_A(a \tensor b)$$
            $L \tensor_k A$ is usually regarded as Lie algebra over $k$ instead of over $A$.  
        \end{convention}
    
        \subsection{A Lie bialgebra structure on \texorpdfstring{$\g[v^{\pm 1}, t]$}{}}
            \begin{definition} \label{def: residue_form_on_loop_algebra}
                For $v$ a formal variable, we can extend the invariant inner product $(-, -)_{\g}$ to the following pairing on $\g[v^{\pm 1}]$ by defining:
                    $$(x f(v), y g(v))_{\g[v^{\pm 1}]} := - (x, y)_{\g} \Res_{v = 0}( v^{-1} f(v) g(v) )$$
                for all $x, y \in \g$ and all $f(v), g(v) \in \bbC[v^{\pm 1}]$, and recall that:
                    $$\Res_{v = 0}\left( \sum_{n \in \Z} a_n v^n \right) := a_{-1}$$
                More algebraically\footnote{So that the definition would work still when we replace $\bbC$ with a general algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$.}, we can define this as:
                    $$(x v^m, y v^n)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}]} := (x, y)_{\g} \delta_{m + n, 0}$$
            \end{definition}
            \begin{definition} \label{def: residue_form_on_multi_loop_algebra}
                Now, let $(-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}]}$ be as in definition \ref{def: residue_form_on_loop_algebra}. This can be extended furthermore to $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]$ in the following manner: for all $X(v), Y(v) \in \g[v^{\pm 1}]$ and all $f(t), g(t) \in \bbC[t^{\pm 1}]$, define:
                    $$(X(v) f(t), Y(v) g(t))_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]} := - (X(v), Y(v))_{\g[v^{\pm 1}]} \Res_{t = 0}( f(t) g(t) )$$
                More algebraically, we can define this as:
                    $$(X(v) f(t), Y(v) g(t))_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]} := (X(v), Y(v))_{\g[v^{\pm 1}]} \delta_{m + n, -1}$$
            \end{definition}

            \begin{question}
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Verify that $(-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]}$ is an invariant and non-degenerate symmetric $\bbC$-bilinear form on $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]$.
                    \item Show that by equpping $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]$ with the invariant inner product $(-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]}$, the following triple of Lie algebras becomes a well-defined Manin triple:
                        $$(\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}], \g[v^{\pm 1}, t], t^{-1}\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{-1}])$$
                    \item Find a formula for the canonical element $\scrR_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t} \in \g[v^{\pm 1}, t] \hattensor_{\bbC} \g[v^{\pm 1}, t]$ with respect to the restriction of $(-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]}$ to $\Sym^2_{\bbC}(\g[v^{\pm 1}, t])$.
                    \item Find the Lie bialgebra structure on $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t]$ arising from the Manin triple in 2.
                \end{enumerate}
            \end{question}
                \begin{proof}
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item The symmetry and bilinearity of $(-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]}$ are clear from the construction of this bilinear pairing as in definition \ref{def: residue_form_on_multi_loop_algebra}. $(-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]}$-invariance follows from the $\g$-invariance of $(-, -)_{\g}$, which is by hypothesis. Finally, non-degeneracy follows from the non-degeneracy of $(-, -)_{\g}$ (also by hypothesis) as well as the non-degeneracy of the residual pairings on $\bbC[v^{\pm 1}]$ (as in definition \ref{def: residue_form_on_loop_algebra}) and on $\bbC[t^{\pm 1}]$ (as in definition \ref{def: residue_form_on_multi_loop_algebra}); to see that the latter point holds, simply note that there exists no $m \in \Z$ such that $\delta_{m + n, - 1} = 0$ (respectively, such that $\delta_{m + n, 0}$) for all $n \in \Z$.
                        \item It is not hard to see that: with respect to the natural $\Z^2$-grading on $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t]$, one has that:
                            $$\g[v^{\pm 1}, t]^{\star} \cong t^{-1}\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{-1}]$$
                        with respect to the invariant inner product $(-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]}$. It is also to see that:
                            $$\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}] \cong \g[v^{\pm 1}, t] \oplus t^{-1}\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{-1}]$$
                        Note also that $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}] \supset \g[v^{\pm 1}, t], t^{-1}\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{-1}]$ are Lie subalgebras; this is simply due to a combination of the fact that $t \in \bbC[t]$ is not a zero-divisor, and hence the localisation map $\bbC[t] \to \bbC[t^{\pm 1}]$ is injective (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00CM}{Tag 00CM}]{stacks}) and that the Lie bracket on these vector spaces are given by extension of scalars. Finally, to prove that $(-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]}$ pairs the vector subspaces $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t], t^{-1}\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{-1}]$ isotropically, simply that there does not exist any $m, n \geq 0$ or $m, n \leq -1$ simultaneously so that:
                            $$\delta_{m + n, -1} = 0$$
                        \item It will be convenient for us to make the identification of topological vector spaces:
                            $$\g[v^{\pm 1}, t] \hattensor_{\bbC} \g[v^{\pm 1}, t] \cong \g[v_2^{\pm 1}, t_1] \hattensor_{\bbC} \g[v^{\pm 1}, t_2]$$
                        Also, let us fix the basis:
                            $$\{X_{m, p}\}_{(m, p) \in \Z^2} := \{x_i v^m t^p\}_{1 \leq i \leq \dim_{\bbC} \g, m \in \Z, p \in \Z}$$
                        for $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]$. It is easy to see that the graded dual of this basis with respect to the invariant inner product $(-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]}$ is:
                            $$\{X_{m, p}^{\star}\}_{(m, p) \in \Z^2} := \{x^i v^{-m} t^{-p - 1}\}_{1 \leq i \leq \dim_{\bbC} \g, m \in \Z, p \in \Z}$$
                        
                        By definition, the canonical element $\scrR_{\g[v_1^{\pm 1}, t]} \in \g[v_2^{\pm 1}, t_1] \hattensor_{\bbC} \g[v^{\pm 1}, t_2]$ is given by:
                            $$\scrR_{\g[v_1^{\pm 1}, t]} := \sum_{(m, p) \in \Z^2} X_{m, p} \hattensor X_{m, p}^{\star}$$
                        As such, we have that:
                            $$
                                \begin{aligned}
                                    \scrR_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]} & := \sum_{1 \leq i \leq \dim_{\bbC} \g} \sum_{m = -\infty}^{+\infty} \sum_{p = -\infty}^{+\infty} x_i v_1^m t_1^p \hattensor x^i v_2^{-m} t_2^{-p - 1}
                                    \\
                                    & = \left( \sum_{1 \leq i \leq \dim_{\bbC} \g} x_i \tensor x^i \right) \left( \lim_{M \to +\infty} \left(\sum_{m = 0}^M (v_1^{-1} v_2)^m \right) + \left(\sum_{m = 0}^M (v_1 v_2^{-1})^m\right) \right) \left( t_2^{-1} \lim_{P \to +\infty} \sum_{p = 0}^P (t_1 t_2^{-1})^p \right)
                                    \\
                                    & = \scrR_{\g} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{1 - v_1 v_2^{-1}} + \frac{1}{1 - v_1^{-1} v_2} \right) \cdot \frac{t_2}{1 - t_1 t_2^{-1}}
                                \end{aligned}
                            $$
                        \item Let us keep the identification:
                            $$\g[v^{\pm 1}, t] \hattensor_{\bbC} \g[v^{\pm 1}, t] \cong \g[v_2^{\pm 1}, t_1] \hattensor_{\bbC} \g[v^{\pm 1}, t_2]$$
                        From \cite[pp. 5]{etingof_kazhdan_quantisation_1}, we know that the Lie bialgebra structure (say, $\delta_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t]}$) on $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]$ is given at any $X(v, t) \in \g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]$ by:
                            $$\delta_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t]}( X(v, t) ) = [X(v_1, t_1) \tensor 1 + 1 \tensor X(v_2, t_2), \scrR_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t]}]$$
                        When $X(v, t) := x v^m t^p$ for some $x \in \g, m \in \Z, t \in \Z_{\geq 0}$, this can written out more explicitly as follows:
                            $$
                                \begin{aligned}
                                    \delta_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t]}( x v^m t^p ) & = \left[x v_1^m t_1^p \tensor 1 + 1 \tensor x v_2^m t_2^p, \scrR_{\g} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{1 - v_1 v_2^{-1}} + \frac{1}{1 - v_1^{-1} v_2} \right) \cdot \frac{t_2}{1 - t_1 t_2^{-1}}\right]
                                    \\
                                    & = [x \tensor 1 + 1 \tensor x, \scrR_{\g}] \cdot v_1^m, t_1^p \cdot v_2^m t_2^p \cdot \left( \frac{1}{1 - v_1 v_2^{-1}} + \frac{1}{1 - v_1^{-1} v_2} \right) \frac{t_2}{1 - t_1 t_2^{-1}}
                                \end{aligned}
                            $$
                    \end{enumerate}
                \end{proof}

        \subsection{Extending the Lie bialgebra structure to \texorpdfstring{$\uce( \g[v^{\pm 1}, t] )$}{}}
            \begin{convention}
                Set $\t := \uce( \g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}] )$ and $\s := \uce( \g[v^{\pm 1}, t] )$. 
            \end{convention}
        
            \begin{question}
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Prove that there is a unique invariant symmetric bilinear form $(-, -)_{\t}$ on $\t$ whose restriction to $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]$ coincides with $(-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]}$.
                    \item Find a Lie subalgebra $\s^{\star} \subset \t$ such that:
                        $$\t \cong \s \oplus \s^{\star}$$
                    and such that $\s^{\star}$ is paired isotropically with $\s$ by $(-, -)_{\t}$. 
                    \item Why is the triple:
                        $$(\t, \s, \s^{\star})$$
                    with $\t$ being equipped with $(-, -)_{\t}$ not a Manin triple ?
                \end{enumerate}
            \end{question}
                \begin{proof}
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Suppose that $B$ is any invariant inner product on $\t$ and fix an element $Z \in \z(\t)$. This gives us:
                            $$B([X, Y], Z) = B(X, [Y, Z]) = B(X, 0) = 0$$
                        for all $X, Y \in \t$. As such, the sought-for unique invariant inner product on $\t$ induced by $(-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]}$, whose restriction to $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}] \subset \t$ coincides with $(-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]}$, must be determined by:
                            $$(X, Z)_{\t} = 0, (Z, Z)_{\t} = 0$$
                        for all $X \in \t$ and all $Z \in \z(\t)$.
                        \item One thing that we are able to gather from 1 is that, with respect to $(-, -)_{\t}$, the centre $\z(\t)$ is orthogonally complementary to $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]$. With this in mind, we claim that:
                            $$\s^{\star} \cong t^{-1}\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{-1}] \oplus \z(\s)^{\bot}$$
                        wherein $\z(\s)^{\bot}$ is such that:
                            $$\z(\t) \cong \z(\s) \oplus \z(\s)^{\bot}$$
                        and note that $\z(\s)^{\bot}$ must exist due to $\s$ being a Lie subalgebra of $\t$ and hence $\z(\s)$ being a Lie subalgebra of $\z(\t)$ (namely, one has that $\z(\s) = \z(\t) \cap \s$). To see that this is indeed that the Lie subalgebra of $\t$ that we are after, firstly note that because:
                            $$(-, -)_{\t}|_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]} = (-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]}$$
                        and because it has been shown that $(-, -)_{\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]}$ pairs $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t]$ and $t^{-1}\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{-1}]$ isotropically as subspaces of $\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]$, the only thing to demonstrate is that $(-, -)_{\t}$ pairs elements of $\z(\s)$ and $\z(\s)^{\bot}$ isotropically with one another in the sense that:
                            $$(\z(\s), \z(\s))_{\t} = (\z(\s)^{\bot}, \z(\s)^{\bot})_{\t} = 0$$
                        This is directly due to the fact that elements of $\z(\s)$ and likewise, those of $\z(\s)^{\bot}$, are central as elements of $\t$. Lastly, one verifies that, one indeed has that:
                            $$\s \oplus \s^{\star} \cong ( \g[v^{\pm 1}, t] \oplus \z(\s) ) \oplus ( t^{-1}\g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{-1}] \oplus \z(\s)^{\bot} ) \cong \g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}] \oplus \z(\t) \cong \t$$
                        \item $(\t, \s, \s^{\star})$ is not a Manin triple (nor a graded Manin triple, for that matter) due to the simple fact that the non-zero vector space $\z(\t)$ is contained entirely in $\Rad (-, -)_{\t} := \{Z \in \t \mid \forall X \in \t: (X, Z)_{\t} = 0\}$. This implies that the invariant inner product $(-, -)_{\t}$ on $\t$ is degenerate, thereby violating the definition of Manin triples. 
                    \end{enumerate}
                \end{proof}
