        \subsection{Structure of finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebras}
            As a precursor to our main discussion, let us recall some features of the theory of finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebras, which in this context is to be thought of as the most well-understood examples of so-called perfect Lie algebras. 

            \begin{definition}[(Semi-)simple Lie algebras]
                A Lie algebra over an arbitrary commutative ring $k$ is said to be \textbf{simple} if and only if it admits no non-zero Lie ideals. A Lie algebra over $k$ is said to be \textbf{semi-simple} if and only if it is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras over $k$. 
            \end{definition}
            \begin{remark}
                As an easy consequence of the definition, semi-simple Lie algebras are centre-less. In this sense, they can be thought of as perfect Lie algebras with trivial centres. 
            \end{remark}

            Over a field $k$ that is algebraically closed and of characteristic $0$, much is known about the structure of a semi-simple Lie algebra $\g$ that is finite-dimensional when regarded as a $k$-vector space. The bulk of the content presented above is discussed in further details in any standard textbook on Lie algebras (cf. e.g. \cite{humphreys_lie_algebras} or the first half of \cite{carter_affine_lie_algebras}).

            Firsly, one of the most important features of finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebras (henceforth implicitly understood to be defined over a characteristic-$0$ and algebraically closed field $k$) is that each such Lie algebra posses an invariant and non-degenerate $k$-bilinear form which is unique up to $k^{\x}$-multiples. The canonical choice is the so-called Killing form, but in various other context, other natural choices such as the trace form are also very useful. 
            \begin{lemma}[The Killing form] \label{lemma: killing_form}
                Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$ and write:
                    $$\ad: \g \to \gl(\g)$$
                for the adjoint representation of $\g$. Define the \textbf{Killing\footnote{Named after Wilhelm Killing.} form} to be the symmetric $k$-bilinear form\footnote{... or equivalently, as a $k$-linear map $\kappa: \Sym^2_k(\g) \to k$.}:
                    $$\kappa: \g \x \g \to k$$
                given by:
                    $$\kappa(x, y) := \trace(\ad(x) \circ \ad(y))$$
                This bilinear form is $\g$-invariant, in the sense that:
                    $$\forall x, y, z \in \g: \kappa([x, y], z) = \kappa(x, [y, z])$$
            \end{lemma}
            \begin{proposition}[Cartan's Semi-simplicity Criterion] \label{prop: cartan_semi_simplicity_criterion}
                Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$. Then, $\g$ will be semi-simple if and only if the Killing form $\kappa$ is non-degenerate. 
            \end{proposition}
            \begin{example}[Failure of Cartan's Criterion over positive characteristics]
                The following example illustrates why it is crucial that we work over characteristic $0$ for the sequel to be valid.

                Let $p \not = 2$ be a prime and consider the Lie algebra $\sl_2(\F_p^{\alg})$, where by $\F_p^{\alg}/\F_p$, we mean a choice of algebraic closure. Suppose that we know that if $L$ is a Lie algebra then for every $x \in L$, the operator $[x, -]: L \to L$ is a derivation (recall that this is a consequence of the Jacobi identity in the definition of Lie algebras). This implies that for every $x \in \sl_2(\F_p^{\alg})$, the operator:
                    $$\ad(x) := [x, -]$$
                is nilpotent, which in turn implies that the Killing form for $\sl_2(\F_p^{\alg})$ is $0$, as nilpotent matrices are of trace zero. At the same time, one can show easily that $\sl_2(\F_p^{\alg})$ is simple by identifying for it the basis:
                    $$\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\}$$
            \end{example}
            \begin{proposition}[Uniqueness of the Killing form] \label{prop: killing_form_uniqueness}
                Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$. If $\kappa'$ is any invariant and non-degenerate symmetric $k$-bilinear form on $\g$ then there will exist $c \in k^{\x}$ such that:
                    $$\kappa' = c \kappa$$
            \end{proposition}

            Now, the existence and uniqueness (up to non-zero scalings) of a non-degenerate and invariant symmetric bilinear form allows us to construct a natural grading of any semi-simple Lie algebra by its \say{root lattice}, which is a certain finite free $\Z$-module of combinatorial origin. 
            \begin{definition}[Cartan subalgebras] \label{def: cartan_subalgebras}
                Suppose that $\g$ is a Lie algebra over an arbitrary field. A \textbf{Cartan subalgebra} of $\g$ is then a Lie subalgebra that is nilpotent and self-normalising.  
            \end{definition}
            \begin{remark}
                Suppose that $\g$ is a Lie algebra over an arbitrary field $k$. If:
                    $$\dim_k \g < |k|$$
                then one is always guaranteed that $\g$ would admit Cartan subalgebras. In particular, any Lie algebra over a field of characteristic $0$ admits a Cartan subalgebra, as such fields have infinite cardinalities. 
            \end{remark}
            \begin{lemma}[Cartan subalgebras are maximal toral subalgebras] \label{lemma: cartan_subalgebras_are_maxaimal_toral_subalgebras}
                Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$. The set of Cartan subalgebras of $\g$ will then be the same as the set of maximal toral Lie subalgebras of $\g$ (i.e. a maximal abelian Lie subalgebra whose elements are semi-simple\footnote{This necessitates the algebraic closure assumption.} under the adjoint representation).  
            \end{lemma}
            \begin{lemma}[Cartan subalgebras are conjugate]
                Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$. Then, every Cartan subalgebra thereof is conjugate to one another, i.e. they are all isomorphic to one another, via inner automorphisms of $\g$. 
            \end{lemma}
            \begin{lemma}[Non-degeneracy of invariant bilinear forms on Cartan subalgebras] \label{lemma: non_degeneracy_of_invariant_bilinear_forms_on_cartan_subalgebras}
                Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$ and choose for it a Cartan subalgebra $\h$. Choose also a non-degenerate and invariant symmetric $k$-bilinear form $(-, -)_{\g}$ on $\g$, regarded as a $k$-linear map:
                    $$(-, -)_{\g}: \Sym_k^2(\g) \to k$$
                Then, the domain restriction of this form to $\Sym_k^2(\h)$ remains non-degenerate. 
            \end{lemma}
            As such, when studying representations of representations of finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$, one can freely choose Cartan subalgebras and then work entirely with respect to that choice. 
            \begin{definition}[Weight spaces and root spaces]
                Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$, and choose for it a Cartan subalgebra $\h$. Let $V$ be a $\g$-module. Then, one can abstractly define the vector subspace of $V$ consisting of elements of \textbf{weight} $\mu \in \h^*$ to be:
                    $$V[\mu] := \{v \in V \mid \forall h \in \h: h \cdot v = \mu(h) v\}$$
                The set of weights $\mu \in \h^*$ such that $V[\mu] \not \cong 0$ is denoted by $\Pi(V)$, and if:
                    $$V \cong \bigoplus_{\mu \in \Pi(V)} V[\mu]$$
                then we will say that $V$ is a \textbf{weight module} for $\g$. 

                When $V \cong \g$ and carries the adjoint action of $\g$, we will instead refer to the non-zero weights as \textbf{roots}.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{theorem}[Root space decomposition for finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebras] \label{theorem: root_space_decomposition_for_finite_dimensional_semi_simple_lie_algebras}
                Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$, and choose for it a Cartan subalgebra $\h$. Then, under the adjoint action, $\g$ becomes a weight module over itself. Furthermore, for each $\alpha \in \Pi(\g) \setminus \{0\}$, one has that:
                    $$\dim_k \g[\alpha] = 1$$
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{convention}
                Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$, choose for it a Cartan subalgebra, and let $\g$ act via the adjoint action on itself. Since Cartan subalgebras are abelian by definition, it is not hard to see that:
                    $$\h \cong \g[0]$$
                and in light of this, one then often writes:
                    $$\Phi := \Pi(\g) \setminus \{0\}$$
                to denote the set of roots of $\g$. The root space decomposition of $\g$ then takes the form:
                    $$\g \cong \h \oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Phi} \g[\alpha]$$
            \end{convention}
            The following is a very useful and conceptual way to think about elements:
                $$x \in \g[\alpha]$$
            (i.e. \say{root vectors}). 
            \begin{lemma}[Action of root vectors]
                Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$ and choose for it a Cartan subalgebra $\h$. Let $V$ be an arbitrary $\g$-module. Then:
                    $$\forall \alpha \in \Phi: \forall \mu \in \Pi(V): \g[\alpha] \cdot V[\mu] \subseteq V[\mu + \alpha]$$
            \end{lemma}
            Before we state an important corollary of this lemma, let us note that thanks to lemma \ref{lemma: non_degeneracy_of_invariant_bilinear_forms_on_cartan_subalgebras}, with respect to a choice of a Cartan subalgebra and a non-degenerate and invariant symmetric $k$-bilnear form on $\g$, one can canonically identify:
                $$\h \xrightarrow[]{\cong} \h^*$$
            via said bilinear form. 
            \begin{corollary}
                Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$ and choose for it a Cartan subalgebra $\h$. Choose also a non-degenerate and invariant symmetric $k$-bilinear form $(-, -)_{\g}$ on $\g$. For any given root:
                    $$\alpha \in \Phi$$
                and corresponding root vectors $x_{\alpha} \in \g[\alpha], x_{\beta} \in \g[\beta]$, one has that:
                    $$[x_{\alpha}, x_{-\alpha}] = (x_{\alpha}, x_{\beta})_{\g} \check{\alpha}$$
                where:
                    $$\check{\alpha} \in \h$$
                is such that:
                    $$(\alpha, \check{\alpha})_{\g} = 2$$
            \end{corollary}
            \begin{proposition}[Pairing of root spaces]
                Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$ and choose for it a Cartan subalgebra $\h$. Fix a non-degenerate and invariant symmetric $k$-bilinear form $(-, -)_{\g}$ on $\g$.
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item The set of roots $\Phi$ is a $k$-linear spanning subset of $\h^*$ (but it is \textit{not} $k$-linearly independent!).
                    \item For a given pair of roots $\alpha, \beta \in \Phi$, one has that:
                        $$(\g[\alpha], \g[\beta])_{\g} \not = 0 \iff \alpha + \beta = 0$$
                    Equivalently, one has that:
                        $$\forall \alpha \in \h^*: \alpha \in \Phi \iff -\alpha \in \Phi$$
                    which shows that $\Phi$ is not $k$-linearly independent.
                \end{enumerate}
            \end{proposition}
            \begin{definition}[Simple roots, positive/negative roots; root systems]
                Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$ and choose for it a Cartan subalgebra $\h$. Fix a non-degenerate and invariant symmetric $k$-bilinear form $(-, -)_{\g}$ on $\g$.
                
                A \textit{choice} of a linearly independent subset of the set of roots $\Phi$ of $\g$ gives a set of \textbf{simple roots}. With respect to such a choice $\Phi^{\circ}$, one regards elements of $\Phi^+ := \Z_{> 0} \Phi^{\circ} \cap \Phi$ as \textbf{positive roots} and those of $\Phi^- := -\Phi^+$ as \textbf{negative roots}; simple roots are therefore positive by convention.

                The triple:
                    $$(\h^*, \Phi, (-, -)_{\g})$$
                is a \textbf{root system} of $\g$, though typically only the set of roots $\Phi$ itself is referred to, as $\h$ (and hence $\h^*$) and $(-, -)_{\g}$ are fixed once and for all. 

                From a root system as above, one can also construct a \textbf{Cartan matrix}. By fixing an enumeration of simple roots:
                    $$\Phi^{\circ} := \{\alpha_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq l}$$
                (with $l := \dim_k \h^*$), one can then construct an $l \x l$ matrix $C := (c_{ij})_{1 \leq i, j \leq l} \in \Mat_l(\Z)$ by setting:
                    $$c_{ij} := (\alpha_i, \check{\alpha}_j)_{\g}$$
            \end{definition}
            \begin{remark}
                It is not hard to see that for every $\alpha \in \Phi$, if we write $s_{\alpha} \in \End_k(\h^*)$ for the operation of reflection about the hyperplane perpendicular to $k \alpha \subseteq \h^*$, then we will have that:
                    $$s_{\alpha}(\Phi) \subseteq \Phi$$
            \end{remark}
            \begin{remark}[Dynkin diagrams]
                It is also not hard to show that the Cartan matrix associated to a root system is an instance of an adjacency matrix of an undirected graph. The graph in question is usually referred to as the \textbf{Dynkin diagram} of $\g$, and it is given by letting the set of vertices be in bijection with the set of simple roots, and the set of undirected edges between vertex $\alpha_i$ and $\alpha_j$, say, to be the integer $a_{ij} := 2 \delta_{ij} - c_{ij}$. From this fact, one can infer that $C$ is necessarily \textit{positive-definite}.

                Though it is less trivial of a task, it is nevertheless very well-known at this point that Dynkin diagrams attached to finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$ are completely classifiable. There are $4$ \say{classical} families/types ($\sfA_l, \sfB_l, \sfC_l, \sfD_l$), and $3$ \say{exceptional} families/types ($\sfF_4, \sfG_2, \sfE_6, \sfE_7, \sfE_8$); among these, the types $\sfA_l, \sfD_l$, and $\sfE_6, \sfE_7, \sfE_8$ are said to be \say{simply laced} as between any two of their distinct vertices, there can be only at most one edge.
                \begin{figure}[H]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{finite_type_dynkin_diagrams.png}
                    \caption{Finite-type Dynkin diagrams}
                    \label{fig: finite_type_dynkin_diagrams}
                \end{figure}
                
                An easy consequence of the construction of Dynkin diagrams from finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebras (one checks whether or not the associated Cartan matrix decomposes into a block sum of two submatrices along the diagonal) is that the function:
                    $$\{ \text{Dynkin diagrams} \} \to \{ \text{finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebras over $k$} \}/\cong$$
                maps disjoint unions to direct sums and therefore, it suffices to ever only consider oneself with finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. When a Dynkin diagram has only one connected component, we say that it is \textbf{connected}.
            \end{remark}
            The following result is a fundamental theorem in the study of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$. It essentially gives a bijective classification:
                $$\{ \text{connected Dynkin diagrams} \} \xrightarrow[]{\cong} \{ \text{finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras over $k$} \}/\cong$$
            which means that to give such a Lie algebra via a presentation by generators and relations is the same as giving its associated Cartan matrix. This is not only practically useful, but also is the mean by which one approaches Kac-Moody algebras, where the Cartan matrix is no longer required to be positive-definite (cf. \cite[Chapters 1-5]{kac_infinite_dimensional_lie_algebras}). 
            \begin{theorem}[Serre's Theorem]
                Let $\g$ be a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ and denote its Cartan matrix by $(c_{ij})_{1 \leq i \leq l}$. Then, $\g$ is isomorphic to the Lie algebra generated by the set:
                    $$\{h_i, e_i^{\pm}\}_{1 \leq i \leq l}$$
                whose elements are subjected to the following relations, given for all $1 \leq i, j \leq l$:
                    $$[h_i, h_j] = 0$$
                    $$[h_i, e_j^{\pm}] = \pm c_{ij} e_j^{\pm}, [e_i^+, e_j^-] = \delta_{ij} h_i$$
                    $$\ad(e_i^{\pm})^{1 - c_{ij}}(e_j^{\pm}) = 0$$
                This is usually referred to as the \textbf{Chevalley-Serre} presentation for $\g$; final set of relations is usually known as the \textbf{Serre relations}.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{corollary}
                For every root $\alpha \in \Phi$, any element $x \in \g[\alpha]$ is nilpotent under the vector representation of $\g$. 
            \end{corollary}
            \begin{corollary}[Triangular decomposition for finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebras]
                Let $\n^{\pm}$ denote the Lie subalgebras of $\g$ generated by the sets $\{e_i^{\pm}\}_{1 \leq i \leq l}$ respectively. Then:
                    $$\g \cong \n^- \oplus \h \oplus \n^+$$
                This is usually called the \textbf{triangular decomposition} for $\g$. 
            \end{corollary}

            We end this subsection with a brief analysis of the easiest possible example of a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra. 
            \begin{example}[$\sl_2$]
                Recall that $\sl_2(k)$ is the kernel of the trace map:
                    $$\trace: \gl_2(k) \to k$$
                i.e. it is the Lie algebra of trace-zero $2 \x 2$-matrices whose Lie bracket is the usual commutator of matrices. It is of dimension $\dim_k \gl_2(k) - \dim_k k = 4 - 1 = 3$, and happens to be also generated by a set of cardinality $3$ (though this is a coincidence, due entirely to how \say{degenerate} of an example $\sl_2(k)$ is):
                    $$\{h, e^+, e^-\}$$
                and the elements of this set are subjected to the relations:
                    $$[h, e^{\pm}] = \pm 2 e^{\pm}, [e^+, e^-] = h$$
                One proves both of these statements by showing firstly that a basis for $\sl_2(k)$ is:
                    $$\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\}$$
                and then seeing that any Cartan subalgebra of $\sl_2(k)$ must therefore be isomorphic to $k \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$; the rest then follows. In particular, the Cartan matrix is just:
                    $$\begin{pmatrix} 2 \end{pmatrix}$$
                and the Dynkin diagram consists of only a single vertex and no edges:
                    $$\bullet$$
                From this, one gathers that $\sl_2(k)$ is of type $\sfA_1$. 
            \end{example}

        \subsection{Perfect Lie algebras and their central extensions}
            \begin{definition}[Perfect Lie algebras]
                A Lie algebra over a commutative ring is said to be \textbf{perfect} if it is equal to its derived subalgebra.

                Since semi-simple Lie algebras lack non-zero ideals by definition, they are perfect.

    \section{Kassel's realisation in terms of cyclic differential 1-forms}
        \begin{convention} \label{conv: a_fixed_finite_dimensional_simple_lie_algebra}
            From now on, we fix a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra:
                $$\g$$
            over $\bbC$, equipped with a symmetric and non-degenerate invariant $\bbC$-bilinear form $(-, -)_{\g}$. It is known that such a bilinear form is unique up to $\bbC^{\x}$-multiples, so for all intents and purposes, it can be assumed to be the Killing form, though this assumption is not necessary. 
    
            Suppose also that $\g$ is equipped with a basis $\{x_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq \dim_{\bbC} \g}$ and with respect to $(-, -)_{\g}$, we identify a dual basis $\{x_i^*\}_{1 \leq i \leq \dim_{\bbC} \g}$. Recall that the Casimir tensor/canonical element of $\g$ is:
                $$\sfr_{\g} := \sum_{1 \leq i \leq \dim_{\bbC} \g} x_i \tensor x_i^* \in \g \tensor_{\bbC} \g^*$$
            and recall that $\sfr_{\g}$ is independent of what we choose the basis vectors $x_i$ to be.
    
            Eventually, we will also be concerned with the Dynkin diagram associated to the root system of $\g$. Let us denote this by:
                $$\Gamma := (\Gamma_0, \Gamma_1)$$
            wherein $\Gamma_0$ means the (finite) set of vertices and $\Gamma_1$ means the set of undirected edges between said vertices. 
    
            The set of all roots and respectively, positive/negative roots, and simple roots of $\g$ shall be denoted by:
                $$\Phi, \Phi^{\pm}, \Phi^{\circ}$$
            The set $\Phi^{\circ}$ is $\Z$-linearly independent and its $\Z$-span:
                $$Q := \Z \Phi^{\circ}$$
            is typically referred to as the root lattice of $\g$. Recall also that there is a set of fundamental weights: if we write:
                $$\check{\Phi}$$
            for the set of coroots of $\g$, then the so-called weight lattice of $\g$ shall be given by\footnote{We avoid the usual $\Delta$ notation, as we would like to reserve this symbol for a coproduct construction on affine Yangians.}:
                $$\Pi := \Hom_{\Z}(\check{Q}, \Z), \check{Q} := \Z\check{\Phi}$$
            inside which lies the set of fundamental weights, whose elements are dual to those of $\check{\Phi}^{\circ}$ (i.e. dual to simple coroots) with respect to $(-, -)_{\g}$\footnote{Which we might as well normalise so that $(\alpha_j, \check{\alpha}_j)_{\g} = 2$ for every $j \in \Gamma_0$, and hence the fundamental weights $\lambda_i$ will be simply be subjected to the relation $\delta_{ij} = 2 \frac{(\lambda_i, \check{\alpha}_i)_{\g}}{(\alpha_j, \check{\alpha}_j)_{\g}} = (\lambda_i, \check{\alpha}_i)_{\g}$.}.
        \end{convention}

            The following well-known lemmas are very useful. A proof can be be found in any standard reference on general commutative algebra (cf. e.g. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00AO}{Tag 00AO}]{stacks}).
            \begin{lemma}[$1$-forms over polynomial algebras]
                \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00RX}{Tag 00RX}]{stacks} Let $k$ be a commutative ring and fix some $n \in \Z_{\geq 0}$, and consider the canonical ring homomorphism $k \to k[v_1, ..., v_n]$. In this case, $\Omega^1_{[n]} := \Omega^1_{k[v_1, ..., v_n]/k}$ will be free and of finite rank $n$ as an $k[v_1, ..., v_n]$-module; in particular, it admits the set $\{dv_1, ..., dv_n\}$ as an $k[v_1, ..., v_n]$-linear basis. 
            \end{lemma}
