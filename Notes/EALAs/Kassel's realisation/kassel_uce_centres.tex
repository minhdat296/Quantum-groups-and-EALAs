\section{The Kassel realisation of UCEs of current Lie algebras}
    \subsection{A recollection of K\"ahler differentials}
        There are many perspectives on algebraic differential forms, but for our purposes, the following will be the easiest to use.
        \begin{definition}[Modules of K\"ahler differentials] \label{def: kahler_differentials}
            Let $k$ be a base commutative ring and let $A$ be a commutative $k$-algebra, defined by a multiplication map:
                $$\mu_{A/k}: A \tensor_k A \to A$$
            The $A$-module of K\"ahler differentials $\Omega^1_{A/k}$ relative to the ring map $k \to A$ is then given by:
                $$\Omega^1_{A/k} := I/I^2$$
            where $I := \ker \mu_{A/k}$. Elements of $\Omega^1_{A/k}$ are typically referred to as (differential) $1$-forms.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{remark}[Diffentials satify the Leibniz rule]
            Observe that the $A \tensor_k A$-ideal:
                $$I := \ker \mu_{A/k}$$
            is generated by elements of the form $1 \tensor f - f \tensor 1$, for all $f \in A$. We then see that:
                $$\Omega^1_{A/k} := I/I^2 \cong I \tensor_{A \tensor_k A} ( (A \tensor_k A)/I ) \cong I \tensor_{A \tensor_k A} A$$
            should we regard $A$ as a commutative $A \tensor_k A$-algebra; note that the last isomorphism holds thanks to the fact that the multiplication map $\mu_{A/k}: A \tensor_k A \to A$ is \textit{a priori} surjective. From this, one infers that there exists a canonical $k$-linear derivation:
                $$d: A \to \Omega^1_{A/k}$$
                $$f \mapsto 1 \tensor f - f \tensor 1$$
            Indeed, for every $f, g \in A$, the Leibniz rule is satisfied:
                $$g df + f dg = g(1 \tensor f - f \tensor 1) + f(1 \tensor g - g \tensor 1) = gf \tensor 1 - fg \tensor 1 = d(fg)$$
        \end{remark}
        The following well-known lemmas are very useful. A proof can be be found in any standard reference on general commutative algebra (cf. e.g. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00AO}{Tag 00AO}]{stacks}).
        \begin{lemma}[Universal property of modules of K\"ahler differentials]
            Let $k$ be a base commutative ring and let $A$ be a commutative $k$-algebra. Then, the $A$-module of K\"ahler differentials relative to the ring map $k \to A$ corepresents the functor of $k$-linear derivations from $A$, i.e. there is a natural isomorphism of functors $A\mod \to A\mod$ as follows:
                $$\Der_k(A, -) \cong \Hom_A(\Omega^1_{A/k}, -)$$
            Because of this, the category of $k$-linear derivations $d_M: A \to M$ admit an initial object, namely $d: A \to \Omega^1_{A/k}$. 
        \end{lemma}
        \begin{corollary}[$1$-forms are dual to derivations]
            $k$-linear derivations from $A$ to itself are dual to differential $1$-forms relative to $k \to A$ in the following manner:
                $$\Der_k(A) := \Der_k(A, A) \cong \Hom_A(\Omega^1_{A/k}, A)$$
        \end{corollary}
        \begin{lemma}[$1$-forms over polynomial algebras]
            \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00RX}{Tag 00RX}]{stacks} Let $k$ be a commutative ring and fix some $n \in \Z_{\geq 0}$, and consider the canonical ring homomorphism $k \to k[v_1, ..., v_n]$. In this case, $\Omega^1_{[n]} := \Omega^1_{k[v_1, ..., v_n]/k}$ will be free and of finite rank $n$ as an $k[v_1, ..., v_n]$-module; in particular, it admits the set $\{dv_1, ..., dv_n\}$ as a $k[v_1, ..., v_n]$-linear basis.
        \end{lemma}
        \begin{corollary}[Derivations as differential operators]
            The $k$-module of $k$-linear derivations from $k[v_1, ..., v_n]$ to itself admit a particularly simple and useful description:
                $$\Der_k(k[v_1, ..., v_n]) \cong \bigoplus_{1 \leq i \leq n} k[v_1, ..., v_n] \del_{v_i}$$
        \end{corollary}

        The notion of \say{smoothness} for homomorphisms of commutative rings is also needed. This can be phrased entirely in terms of algebraic differential forms. 
        \begin{lemma}[Functoriality of modules of $1$-forms]
            
        \end{lemma}
        \begin{definition}[Na\"ive cotangent complexes] \label{def: naive_cotangent_complexes}
            Let $R \to S$ be a homomorphism of commutative rings. 
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}[Smooth ring maps] \label{def: smooth_ring_maps}
            A homomorphism of commutative rings:
                $$R \to S$$
            that is of finite presentation\footnote{... which is to say, $S$ is finitely presented as a commutative $R$-algebra, i.e. there exists some $n \geq 0$ and a finitely generated $R[x_1, ..., x_n]$-ideal $I$ for which there is an $R$-algebra isomorphism $S \cong R[x_1, ..., x_n]/I$.} is said to be \textbf{smooth} if its na\"ive cotangent complex $\L^{[-1, 0]}_{S/R}$ is quasi-isomorphic to a finite projective\footnote{Equivalently, finite and locally free (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00NX}{Tag 00NX}]{stacks}).} $S$-module placed in cohomological degree $0$. 
        \end{definition}

        For later use, let us state the following construction.
        \begin{proposition}[Algebraic de Rham complexes] \label{prop: algebraic_de_rham_complexes}
            Let $R \to S$ be a homomorphism of commutative rings. Then, there exists a canonical chain complex of $S$-modules:
                $$\Omega_{S/R}^{\bullet} := \{0 \to S \xrightarrow[]{d} \Omega^1_{S/R} \xrightarrow[]{d \wedge \id} \Omega^2_{S/R} \xrightarrow[]{d \wedge \id} ... \}$$
            where for each $p \in \Z_{\geq 0}$, we set:
                $$\Omega^q_{S/R} := \bigwedge^q \Omega^1_{S/R}$$
        \end{proposition}
        \begin{lemma}[Vanishing of higher de Rham cohomologies: affine case]
            Suppose that $R \to S$ is a homomorphism of commutative $\Q$-algebras. Then, for all $p \geq 1$, one has that:
                $$H^p_{\dR}(S/R) := H^p(\Omega^{\bullet}_{S/R}) \cong 0$$
        \end{lemma}

    \subsection{Hochschild and cyclic (co)homologies}
        \begin{convention}
            Fix a field $k$ of charactersitic $0$. For each $n \geq 0$, write:
                $$P_{[n]} := k[v_1, ..., v_n]$$
        \end{convention}
        
        \begin{definition}[Hochschild (co)homology] \label{def: hochschild_(co)homology}
            Let $A$ be an associative $k$-algebra and write:
                $$A^e := A \tensor_k A^{\op}$$
            to mean the \textbf{enveloping algebra} of $A$; note that there is a canonical isomorphism:
                $$A^e \cong (A^e)^{\op}$$
            and that there are equivalences of abelian categories:
                $${}^lA^e\mod \cong {}^rA^e\mod \cong A\bimod$$

            The functors of \textbf{Hochschild homology and cohomology} of $A$ (with coefficients in $A$-bimodules) are then given in components by:
                $$\HH^{-p}(A, -) := \Tor_{A^e}^p(A, -), \HH^p(A, -) := \Ext_{A^e}^p(A, -)$$
            with $p \in \Z_{\geq 0}$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{convention}
            As a shorthand, let us write:
                $$\HH^{-i}(A) := \Tor_{A^e}^i(A, A), \HH^i(A) := \Ext_{A^e}^i(A, A)$$
            for every $i \geq 0$.
        \end{convention}
        \begin{lemma}
            Fix some $n \geq 0$. For every $p \geq 0$, the $\Ext$-algebra $\HH^{-p}(P_{[n]})$ is identified with the exterior algebra generated by $dv_1, ..., dv_n$:
                $$\HH^{-p}(P_{[n]}) \cong \bigwedge^p ( \bigoplus_{1 \leq i \leq n} \bbC dv_i )$$
        \end{lemma}
        \begin{proposition}
            
        \end{proposition}

    \subsection{Centres of UCEs of current Lie algebras via cyclic homology}
        \begin{convention} \label{conv: a_fixed_finite_dimensional_simple_lie_algebra}
            From now on, we fix a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra:
                $$\g$$
            over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$, equipped with a symmetric and non-degenerate invariant $k$-bilinear form $(-, -)_{\g}$. It is known that such a bilinear form is unique up to $k^{\x}$-multiples, so for all intents and purposes, it can be assumed to be the Killing form, though this assumption is not necessary. 
    
            Suppose also that $\g$ is equipped with a basis $\{x_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq \dim_k \g}$ and with respect to $(-, -)_{\g}$, we identify a dual basis $\{x_i^*\}_{1 \leq i \leq \dim_k \g}$. Recall that the Casimir tensor/canonical element of $\g$ is:
                $$\sfr_{\g} := \sum_{1 \leq i \leq \dim_k \g} x_i \tensor x_i^* \in \g \tensor_k \g^*$$
            and recall that $\sfr_{\g}$ is independent of what we choose the basis vectors $x_i$ to be.
    
            Eventually, we will also be concerned with the Dynkin diagram associated to the root system of $\g$. Let us denote this by:
                $$\Gamma := (\Gamma_0, \Gamma_1)$$
            wherein $\Gamma_0$ means the (finite) set of vertices and $\Gamma_1$ means the set of undirected edges between said vertices. 
    
            The set of all roots and respectively, positive/negative roots, and simple roots of $\g$ shall be denoted by:
                $$\Phi, \Phi^{\pm}, \Phi^{\circ}$$
            The set $\Phi^{\circ}$ is $\Z$-linearly independent and its $\Z$-span:
                $$Q := \Z \Phi^{\circ}$$
            is typically referred to as the root lattice of $\g$. Recall also that there is a set of fundamental weights: if we write:
                $$\check{\Phi}$$
            for the set of coroots of $\g$, then the so-called weight lattice of $\g$ shall be given by\footnote{We avoid the usual $\Delta$ notation, as we would like to reserve this symbol for a coproduct construction on affine Yangians.}:
                $$\Pi := \Hom_{\Z}(\check{Q}, \Z), \check{Q} := \Z\check{\Phi}$$
            inside which lies the set of fundamental weights, whose elements are dual to those of $\check{\Phi}^{\circ}$ (i.e. dual to simple coroots) with respect to $(-, -)_{\g}$\footnote{Which we might as well normalise so that $(\alpha_j, \check{\alpha}_j)_{\g} = 2$ for every $j \in \Gamma_0$, and hence the fundamental weights $\lambda_i$ will be simply be subjected to the relation $\delta_{ij} = 2 \frac{(\lambda_i, \check{\alpha}_i)_{\g}}{(\alpha_j, \check{\alpha}_j)_{\g}} = (\lambda_i, \check{\alpha}_i)_{\g}$.}.
        \end{convention}

        \begin{convention}
            Let us fix a commutative $k$-algebra $A$.

            We shall be writing:
                $$\g_A := \g \tensor_k A$$
            and endow this $k$-vector space with the following Lie bracket:
                $$\forall x, y \in \g: \forall f, g \in A: [x f, y g]_{\g_A} := [x, y]_{\g} fg$$
        \end{convention}

        \begin{definition}[Cyclic differential forms]
            Suppose that $k$ is a commutative ring and $A$ a commutative $k$-algebra. Then, the space of \textbf{cyclic differential $p$-forms} relative to the ring map $k \to A$ is the $k$-module given by:
                $$\bar{\Omega}^p_{A/k} := \Omega^p_{A/k}/d\Omega^{p - 1}_{A/k}$$
        \end{definition}
        \begin{lemma}[Cyclic de Rham complexes] \label{lemma: cyclic_de_rham_complexes}
            
        \end{lemma}

        \begin{lemma}[$H^{-2}_{\Lie}$ = kernels of UCEs] \label{lemma: kenel_of_UCEs_of_perfect_lie_algebras_is_2nd_homology}
            Suppose for a moment that $k$ is simply a general field.

            Let $\a$ be a perfect Lie algebra over $k$. From proposition \ref{prop: perfect_lie_algebras_admit_UCEs}, we know that such a Lie algebra admits a UCE:
                $$0 \to \z \to \uce(\a) \xrightarrow[]{\pi} \a \to 0$$
            over $k$. We have a \textit{canonical} characterisation of the UCE kernel $\z$ as follows:
                $$\z \cong H^{-2}_{\Lie}(\a, k)$$
        \end{lemma}
        \begin{theorem}[The Kassel realisation] \label{theorem: kassel_realisation}
            \cite[Corollary 3.5]{kassel_universal_central_extensions_of_lie_algebras} Let $k$ now an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ again, as in convention \ref{conv: a_fixed_finite_dimensional_simple_lie_algebra}. 

            For the perfect Lie $k$-algebra $\g_A$, we have that:
                $$H^{-2}_{\Lie}(\g_A, k) \cong \bar{\Omega}^1_{A/k}$$
            As an immediate corollary, this implies that:
                $$\uce(\g_A) \cong \g_A \oplus \bar{\Omega}^1_{A/k}$$
        \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
                
            \end{proof}
