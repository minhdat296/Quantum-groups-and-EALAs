    \subsection{Structure of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras}
        As a precursor to our main discussion, let us recall some features of the theory of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras, particularly about their structure.

        \begin{definition}[Simple Lie algebras]
            A Lie algebra over an arbitrary commutative ring $k$ is said to be \textbf{simple} if and only if it admits no non-zero Lie ideals. 
        \end{definition}

        Over a field $k$ that is algebraically closed and of characteristic $0$, much is known about the structure of a simple Lie algebra $\g$ that is finite-dimensional when regarded as a $k$-vector space. The bulk of the content presented above is discussed in further details in any standard textbook on Lie algebras (cf. e.g. \cite{humphreys_lie_algebras} or the first half of \cite{carter_affine_lie_algebras}). Let us give a very brief recap of this theory.

        Firsly, one of the most important features of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras (henceforth implicitly understood to be defined over a characteristic-$0$ and algebraically closed field $k$) is that each such Lie algebra, say $\g$, posses an invariant and non-degenerate $k$-bilinear form:
            $$(-, -)_{\g}$$
        which is unique up to $k^{\x}$-multiples. The canonical choice is the so-called Killing form, given by $\kappa(x, y) := \trace(\ad(x) \circ \ad(y))$ for all $x, y \in \g$, but in various other context, other natural choices such as the trace form $\trace(xy)$ are also very useful. What is important to us is that the Killing form is essentially unique: if $\kappa'$ is any invariant and non-degenerate symmetric $k$-bilinear form on $\g$ then there will exist a \textit{unique} $c \in k^{\x}$ such that $\kappa' = c \kappa$.

        Now, such a bilinear form $(-, -)_{\g}$ allows us to construct a natural grading of any simple Lie algebra $\g$ by its \say{root lattice} (to be defined shortly). One begins this process by choosing a \textbf{Cartan subalgebra} $\h$ for $\g$, which is a maximal abelian Lie subalgebra\footnote{... and it is well-known that all Cartan subalgebras of $\g$ are conjugate to one another, so this choice does not matter.} of $\g$. The restriction of $(-, -)_{\g}$ to $\h$ remains non-degenerate, so we can canonically identify $\h \xrightarrow[]{\cong} \h^*$ via said bilinear form. By picking a basis for our choice of a Catan subalgebra $\h$ and hence a dual basis:
            $$\simpleroots := \{\alpha_i\}_{i \in \simpleroots}$$
        for $\h^*$, which we shall regard as a choice of a set of \textbf{simple roots}, and writing our bilinear form $(-, -)_{\g}$ in terms of that matrix, we shall get the \textbf{Cartan matrix} of $\g$:
            $$C := (c_{ij})_{i, j \in \simpleroots}$$
        The aforementioned \textbf{root lattice} is then given by:
            $$Q := \Z \simpleroots$$
        Given an element:
            $$\mu := \sum_{i \in \simpleroots} m_i \alpha_i \in Q$$
        we define its \textbf{height} to be the sum of the coefficients:
            $$\height \mu := \sum_{i \in \simpleroots} m_i$$
        It can also be shown that $2\id - C$ is the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph without loops, called the \textbf{Dynkin diagram} of $\g$, and the \textbf{roots} of $\g$ are the roots of this Dynkin diagram.
            
        Let $V$ be a $\g$-module. Then, one can abstractly define the vector subspace of $V$ consisting of elements of \textbf{weight} $\mu \in \h^*$ to be:
            $$V_{\mu} := \{v \in V \mid \forall h \in \h: h \cdot v = \mu(h) v\}$$
        If we have a direct sum decomposition of $\h$-module:
            $$V \cong \bigoplus_{\mu \in \h^*} V_{\mu}$$
        then we will say that $V$ is a \textbf{weight module} for $\g$. Interestingly, elements of $\g_{\alpha}$ (with $\g$ acting on itself by the adjoint action) act by raising/lowering the weights of elements of $\g$-modules $V$ in the sense that:
            $$\g_{\alpha} \cdot V_{\mu} \subseteq V_{\mu + \alpha}$$
        for all weights $\alpha, \mu \in \h^*$. 
        
        As it turns out, the $Q$-grading of $\g$ that was mentioned earlier is actually a weight space decomposition for $\g$, regarded as a module over itself via the adjoint representation.
        \begin{theorem}[Root space decomposition for finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras] \label{theorem: root_space_decomposition_for_finite_dimensional_simple_lie_algebras}
            Let $\g$ be a module over itself via the adjoint representation.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item $\g$ is a weight module over itself. As a particular consequence, $\g$ is graded by the abelian group $Q$: for every $x \in \g_{\alpha}$, one has that $\deg x = \height \alpha$.
                \item The weight space $\g_0$ is nothing but the Cartan subalgebra $\h$.
                \item For each non-zero weight $\alpha$ of this $\g$-module, $\dim_k \g_{\alpha} = 1$.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{theorem}
        Typically, the non-zero weights $\alpha$ of the adjoint representations of $\g$ such that $\g_{\alpha} \not \cong 0$ are called \textbf{roots}. The set of roots is usually denoted by $\Phi$. These are the same as the roots that can be constructed from the Cartan matrix of $\g$.

        Elements of $Q^+ := \Z_{\geq 0} \simpleroots$ are typically regarded as being \textbf{positive} (and in particular, the simple roots are positive by convention) and conversely, elements of $Q^- := \Z_{\leq 0} \simpleroots$ are typically said to be \textbf{negative}. One can subsequently construct the sets of positive/negative roots as:
            $$\Phi^{\pm} := \Phi \cap Q^{\pm}$$
        and note that $\Phi = \Phi^+ \cup \Phi^-$.

        From theorem \ref{theorem: root_space_decomposition_for_finite_dimensional_simple_lie_algebras}, we see that for any given positive root $\alpha \in \Phi^+$ and corresponding choice of root vectors\footnote{Choices of which are unique up to non-zero scalar multiples, since subspaces of non-zero weights are equally $1$-dimensional.} $x_{\pm\alpha} \in \g_{\pm\alpha}$, one has that:
            $$[x_{\alpha}, x_{-\alpha}] = \frac12 (x_{\alpha}, x_{-\alpha})_{\g} \check{\alpha}$$
        where $\check{\alpha} \in \h$ is such that $(\alpha, \check{\alpha})_{\g} = 2$. For simplicity, the root vectors $x_{\pm \alpha}$ are typically chosen so that $(x_{\alpha}, x_{-\alpha})_{\g} = 2$.
        
        The next result is a fundamental theorem in the study of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$. It essentially asserts that to give such a Lie algebra via a presentation by generators and relations is the same as to specify its Cartan matrix. The result is not only practically useful, but also is the mean by which one approaches Kac-Moody algebras, where the Cartan matrix is no longer required to be positive-definite (cf. \cite[Chapters 1-5]{kac_infinite_dimensional_lie_algebras}). 
        \begin{theorem}[Serre's Theorem]
            $\g$ is isomorphic to the Lie algebra generated by the set:
                $$\{h_i, x_i^{\pm}\}_{1 \leq i \leq l}$$
            whose elements are subjected to the following relations, given for all $1 \leq i, j \leq l$:
                $$[h_i, h_j] = 0$$
                $$[h_i, x_j^{\pm}] = \pm c_{ij} x_j^{\pm}, [x_i^+, x_j^-] = \delta_{ij} h_i$$
                $$\ad(x_i^{\pm})^{1 - c_{ij}}(x_j^{\pm}) = 0$$
            This is usually referred to as the \textbf{Chevalley-Serre} presentation for $\g$; final set of relations is usually known as the \textbf{Serre relations}.
        \end{theorem}

        We end this subsection with a brief analysis of the easiest possible example of a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra. 
        \begin{example}[$\sl_2$]
            Recall that $\sl_2(k)$ is the kernel of the trace map:
                $$\trace: \gl_2(k) \to k$$
            i.e. it is the Lie algebra of trace-zero $2 \x 2$-matrices whose Lie bracket is the usual commutator of matrices. It is of dimension $\dim_k \gl_2(k) - \dim_k k = 4 - 1 = 3$, and happens to be also generated by a set of cardinality $3$ (though this is a coincidence, due entirely to how \say{degenerate} of an example $\sl_2(k)$ is):
                $$\{h, x^+, x^-\}$$
            and the elements of this set are subjected to the relations:
                $$[h, x^{\pm}] = \pm 2 x^{\pm}, [x^+, x^-] = h$$
            One proves both of these statements by showing firstly that a basis for $\sl_2(k)$ is:
                $$\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\}$$
            and then seeing that any Cartan subalgebra of $\sl_2(k)$ must therefore be isomorphic to $k \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$; the rest then follows. In particular, the Cartan matrix is just:
                $$\begin{pmatrix} 2 \end{pmatrix}$$
            and the Dynkin diagram consists of only a single vertex and no edges:
                $$\bullet$$
        \end{example}

    \subsection{Perfect Lie algebras and their central extensions}
        \begin{definition}[Extensions of Lie algebras]
            Let $k$ be a commutative ring and $\a$ be a Lie algebra over $k$. An \textbf{extension} of $\a$ by another Lie algebra $\z$ over $k$ is an extension of $k$-modules:
                $$0 \to \z \to \frake \xrightarrow[]{\pi} \a \to 0$$
            such that $\frake$ is also a Lie algebra over $k$. A morphism of extensions of a Lie algebra $\a$ by another Lie algebra $\z$ is a morphism of short exact sequences of Lie algebras:
                $$
                    \begin{tikzcd}
                	&& {\frake'} \\
                	0 & \z & \frake & \a & 0
                	\arrow["\varphi", from=1-3, to=2-3]
                	\arrow["{\pi'}", two heads, from=1-3, to=2-4]
                	\arrow["\pi", two heads, from=2-3, to=2-4]
                	\arrow[from=2-2, to=2-3]
                	\arrow[from=2-2, to=1-3]
                	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
                	\arrow[from=2-4, to=2-5]
                    \end{tikzcd}
                $$
            An isomorphism of extension occurs if $\varphi: \frake' \to \frake$ is a Lie algebra isomorphism. An extension:
                $$0 \to \z \to \tilde{\a} \to \a \to 0$$
            of $\a$ by $\z$ is said to be \textbf{universal} if it is initial amongst all such Lie algebra extensions, in the sense that for every other extension:
                $$0 \to \z \to \frake \to \a \to 0$$
            there must exist a unique Lie algebra homomorphism $\tilde{\a} \to \frake$ fitting into the following morphism of extensions:
                $$
                    \begin{tikzcd}
                	&& {\tilde{\a}} \\
                	0 & \z & \frake & \a & 0
                	\arrow[dashed, from=1-3, to=2-3]
                	\arrow[two heads, from=1-3, to=2-4]
                	\arrow[two heads, from=2-3, to=2-4]
                	\arrow[from=2-2, to=2-3]
                	\arrow[from=2-2, to=1-3]
                	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
                	\arrow[from=2-4, to=2-5]
                    \end{tikzcd}
                $$
        \end{definition}
        \begin{remark}
            Universal extensions are unique up to unique isomorphisms. 
        \end{remark}
        \begin{remark}[Lie brackets on extensions]
            Suppose that:
                $$0 \to \z \to \frake \to \a \to 0$$
            is an extension of Lie algebras. Then, up to a choice of so-called \say{$2$-cocycle} $\sigma$, which can be regarded as a $k$-linear map:
                $$\sigma: \bigwedge^2 \a \to \z$$:
            satisfying a certain condition, the Lie bracket on $\frake$ will be given by:
                $$\forall X, Y \in \a: \forall K, K' \in \z: [ (X, K), (Y, K') ]_{\frake} := [X, Y]_{\a} + ( K \cdot Y - K' \cdot Y + \sigma(X, Y) )$$
            The aforementioned condition is that the bracket operation $[-, -]_{\frake}$ satisfies the Jacobi identity (note that it is already bilinear and skew-symmetric by construction).
        \end{remark}
        \begin{example}[Semi-direct products of Lie algebras]
            Let $\d$ be a Lie algebra acting on another Lie algebra $\z$, i.e. let $\t$ be a $\d$-module that happens also to be a Lie algebra over $k$. The canonical extension of $\d$ by $\z$ corresponding to the $2$-cocycle:
                $$\sigma = 0$$
            is known as the \textbf{semi-direct product} of $\d$ by $\z$, and commonly denoted by:
                $$\z \rtimes \d$$
            For the sake of completeness, let us note that the Lie bracket here is given by:
                $$\forall D, D' \in \d: \forall K, K' \in \z: [ (D, K), (D', K') ]_{\z \rtimes \d} := [D, D']_{\d} + ( D \cdot K' - D' \cdot K )$$
        \end{example}
        \begin{definition}[Central extensions of Lie algebras]
            A Lie algebra extension:
                $$0 \to \z \to \frake \to \a \to 0$$
            is \textbf{central} if the elements of $\z$ are central in $\frake$. A \textbf{universal central extension} (UCE) of a Lie algebra $\a$ by another Lie algebra $\z$, typically denoted by $\uce(\a)$, is an extension that is initial amongst all such central extensions.
        \end{definition}

        A particular class of Lie algebras that happen to admit UCEs are the so-called \say{perfect} ones.
        \begin{definition}[Perfect Lie algebras]
            A Lie algebra over a commutative ring is said to be \textbf{perfect} if it is equal to its derived subalgebra. 
        \end{definition}
        \begin{example}
            Since simple Lie algebras lack non-zero ideals by definition, they are perfect. 
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            Let $A$ be any commutative algebra over some base commutative ring $k$, and let $\g$ be a simple Lie algebra over $k$. Endow the $k$-module $\g_A := \g \tensor_k A$ with the Lie bracket:
                $$\forall x, y \in \g: \forall f, g \in A: [x f, y g]_{\g_A} := [x, y]_{\g} fg$$
            Then, $\g_A$ will be perfect when regraded as a Lie algebra over $k$, precisely because $\g$ is simple.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            Counter-examples include nilpotent and abelian Lie algebras. For the former, their derived subalgebras are always proper Lie subalgebras, while for the latter, their derived subalgebras are zero. 
        \end{example}
        \begin{proposition}[Perfect Lie algebras admit UCEs] \label{prop: perfect_lie_algebras_admit_UCEs}
            \cite[Lemma 1.10]{garland_arithmetics_of_loop_groups} If $k$ is a field and $\a$ is a perfect Lie algebra over $k$, then it will admit a UCE.
        \end{proposition}
