    \begin{abstract}
        These are some notes on the construction of certain topological Lie bialgebras - so-called \say{toroidal Lie bialgebras} - which shall be demonstrated to be the classical limits of formal Yangians associated to affine Kac-Moody algebras (outside of types $\sfA_1^{(1)}$ and $\sfA_1^{(2)}$). As toroidal Lie algebras have non-trivial centres, thereby forcing any invariant bilinear form thereon to be degenerate, the construction of the aforementioned toroidal Lie bialgebra structures necessitates enlarging the toroidal Lie algebras to so-called \say{extended toroidal Lie algebras}, on which invariant bilinear form can be non-degenerate, which permits the construction of Manin triples from which Lie bialgebra structures can arise.

    \section{Introduction}
        Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimenisonal simple Lie algebra over $\bbC$.
        
        The point of these notes is to establish, in a certain sense, that the formal Yangian $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$ associated to the untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra $\hat{\g}_{[1]}$ associated to $\g$ (in the sense of \cite[Chapter 7]{kac_infinite_dimensional_lie_algebras}) has a \say{Hopf classical limit}. While it is known that $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$ carries a kind of \say{coproduct} (cf. \cite{guay_nakajima_wendlandt_affine_yangian_coproduct}), behaving very similarly to the Hopf coproduct on the finite-type formal Yangian $\rmY_{\hbar}(\g)$, and also that $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$ is a graded flat deformation of the universal enveloping algebra $\rmU(\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+)$ of the universal central extension $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ of $\g_{[2]}^+ := \g[v^{\pm}, t]$, much like how $\rmY_{\hbar}(\g)$ is a graded flat deformation of $\rmU(\g[t])$ (cf. \cite{chari_pressley_quantum_groups}), the problem that we must tackle here stems from the fact that it is not at all obvious how one might endow $\g_{[2]}^+$ with a Lie bialgebra structure quantising to the aforementioned \say{coproduct} on $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$. This issue, in turn, originates directly from the structure of the Lie algebra $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ itself: unlike $\g[t]$, it has a centre, meaning that any invariant bilinear form on $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ is necessarily degenerate (cf. question \ref{question: extending_invariant_inner_products_on_multi_loop_to_universal_central_extensions}).

        To remedy this issue, the natural thing to attempt is to enlarge $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ by an orthogonal complement of the centre $\z_{[2]}^+$ of $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$.
