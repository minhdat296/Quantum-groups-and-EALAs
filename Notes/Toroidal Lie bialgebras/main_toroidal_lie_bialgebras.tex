        These are some notes on the construction of certain topological Lie bialgebras - so-called \say{toroidal Lie bialgebras} - which shall be demonstrated to be the classical limits of formal Yangians associated to affine Kac-Moody algebras (outside of types $\sfA_1^{(1)}$ and $\sfA_1^{(2)}$). As toroidal Lie algebras have non-trivial centres, thereby forcing any invariant bilinear form thereon to be degenerate, the construction of the aforementioned toroidal Lie bialgebra structures necessitates enlarging the toroidal Lie algebras to so-called \say{extended toroidal Lie algebras}, on which invariant bilinear form can be non-degenerate, which permits the construction of Manin triples from which Lie bialgebra structures can arise.

    \section{Introduction}
        Suppose that $\g$ is a finite-dimenisonal simple Lie algebra over $\bbC$.
        
        \subsection{Classical limits of affine Yangians}
            The goal for these notes is to establish, in a certain sense, that the formal Yangian $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$ associated to the untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra $\hat{\g}_{[1]}$ associated to $\g$ (in the sense of \cite[Chapter 7]{kac_infinite_dimensional_lie_algebras}) has a \say{Hopf classical limit}. While it is known that $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$ carries a kind of \say{coproduct} (cf. \cite{guay_nakajima_wendlandt_affine_yangian_coproduct}), behaving very similarly to the Hopf coproduct on the finite-type formal Yangian $\rmY_{\hbar}(\g)$, and also that $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$ is a graded flat deformation of the universal enveloping algebra $\rmU(\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+)$ of the universal central extension $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ of $\g_{[2]}^+ := \g[v^{\pm}, t]$, much like how $\rmY_{\hbar}(\g)$ is a graded flat deformation of $\rmU(\g[t])$ (cf. \cite{chari_pressley_quantum_groups}), the problem that we must tackle here stems from the fact that it is not at all obvious how one might endow $\g_{[2]}^+$ with a Lie bialgebra structure quantising to the aforementioned \say{coproduct} on $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$. This issue, in turn, originates directly from the structure of the Lie algebra $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ itself: unlike $\g[t]$, it has a centre, meaning that any invariant bilinear form on $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ is necessarily degenerate (cf. question \ref{question: extending_invariant_inner_products_on_multi_loop_to_universal_central_extensions}).

            To remedy this issue, the natural thing to attempt is to enlarge $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ by an orthogonal complement of the centre $\z_{[2]}^+$ of $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$; the resulting enlarged Lie algebra is denoted by $\hat{\g}_{[2]}^+$ (cf. theorem \ref{theorem: extended_toroidal_lie_algebras}). Interestingly, said orthogonal complement turns out to be spanned by certain derivations on $\bbC[v^{\pm 1}, t]$ (cf. remark \ref{remark: dual_of_toroidal_centres_contains_derivations}), thus making $\hat{\g}_{[2]}^+$ strongly resemble the so-called \say{extended affine Lie algebras} (of nullity $2$)\todo{Give a citation for EALAs}. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Lie algebra structure on $\hat{\g}_{[2]}^+$ is highly constrained, with the only degree of freedom lying in what the $\z_{[2]}$-summands of the commutators between the aforementioned derivations are (\textit{a priori}, these commutators are elements of $\hat{\g}_{[2]}$, but we shall show that they in fact lie within $\z_{[2]} \oplus \d_{[2]}$; cf. remark \ref{remark: dual_of_toroidal_centres_contains_derivations}).
    
            Given the construction of $\hat{\g}_{[2]}^+$, we see that this Lie algebra can support \textit{non-degenerate} invariant bilinear forms on it, meaning that it can carry Lie bialgebra structures, and such a Lie cobracket is constructed in corollary \ref{coro: extended_toroidal_lie_bialgebras}. Now, what is rather interesting is that this cobracket restricts down to a well-defined Lie bialgebra structure on $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}$, which is then shown in theorem \ref{theorem: toroidal_lie_algebras_as_classical_limits_of_formal_affine_yangians} to be the classical limit of the \say{coproduct} on $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$ constructed in \cite{guay_nakajima_wendlandt_affine_yangian_coproduct}. We caution the reader that this is not exactly the same notion of a classical limit as in \cite{etingof_kazhdan_quantisation_1}, since the aforementioned \say{coproduct} $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$ is merely an algebra homomorphism from $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$ to another associative algebra that resembles (a topological completion of) the algebraic tensor product $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]}) \tensor_{\bbC} \rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$. 

            One subtlety that must be dealt with when dealing with affine Yangians - as opposed to finite-type Yangians - is the matter of topological completeness. The Lie (bi)algebra $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ is infinite-dimensional, but luckily it is graded, so one strategy is to attempt to complete the algebraic tensor product $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+ \tensor_{\bbC} \tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ with respect to the induced grading thereon. The codomain of the Lie cobracket on $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ ought then to be contained in this grading completion. We should note, also, that unlike $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$, the Lie bialgebra $\hat{\g}_{[2]}^+$ is actually \textit{not} graded, which is why we have not taken up the task of quantising it within these notes. 

        \subsection{What have we \textit{not} done ?}
            In \cite{guay_nakajima_wendlandt_affine_yangian_coproduct}, the authors constructed the \say{Hopf coproduct} on $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$ by essentially taking a limit over binary tensor products of representations in the category $\calO$ of $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$; recall that one has tensor products of modules over any Hopf algebra, after all. The decision to involve the category $\calO$ may seem arbitrary, but it is ultimately necessary because objects therein are acted upon locally nilpotently by $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$, which helps us do away with having to topologically complete anything. 
        
            One can therefore make an argument for - instead of pursuing a genuine Hopf coproduct on $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$ - seeking a notion of a category $\calO$ for $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ that:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item is closed under tensor products over $\bbC$
                \item is a \say{classical limit} of the category $\calO$ of $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$.
            \end{itemize}
            For technical reasons, it might perhaps be better (and even necessary) to seek for such a category $\calO$ for the universal central extension $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}$ of $\g_{[2]} := \g[v^{\pm 1}, t^{\pm 1}]$, which ought somehow to be the \say{classical limit} of some kind of a category $\calO$ for the so-called \say{restricted quantum double} of $\rmY_{\hbar}(\hat{\g}_{[1]})$ (cf. \cite{wendlandt_restricted_quantum_doubles_of_yangians}). In any event, the point here is that the Lie bialgebra structure on $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ can perhaps be realised as a limit over tensor products of representations in the category $\calO$ thereof. An outstanding difficulty in accomplishing this task is the current lack of understanding of weight modules for either $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ or $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}$ (or for that matter, for affine Yangians and their restricted quantum doubles).

            Yet another argument in favour of pursuing the aforementioned notion of a category $\calO$ for $\tilde{\g}_{[2]}^+$ comes from symplectic geometry. \todo{Something about quantisations of Grassmannian slices ...}
